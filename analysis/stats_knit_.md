# Data Reuse and the Open Data Citation Advantage
*Piwowar, Carlson, Vision*


## Goal
1. Is there an association between data availability and citation rate, independently of important known citation predictors?
1. Is there supporting evidence that additional citations are due to data reuse?

## Abstract

See the [end of this document](#abstract-1) (at the end so it can pull in results from the R analysis).

## Introduction

"Sharing information facilitates science. Publicly sharing detailed research data–sample attributes, clinical factors, patient outcomes, DNA sequences, raw mRNA microarray measurements–with other researchers allows these valuable resources to contribute far beyond their original analysis. In addition to being used to confirm original results, raw data can be used to explore related or new hypotheses, particularly when combined with other publicly available data sets. Real data is indispensable when investigating and developing study methods, analysis techniques, and software implementations. The larger scientific community also benefits: sharing data encourages multiple perspectives, helps to identify errors, discourages fraud, is useful for training new researchers, and increases efficient use of funding and patient population resources by avoiding duplicate data collection." [Piwowar, 2007]

Making research data publicly available also has costs. Data archives must be created and maintained. Data must be documented, formatted, and uploaded. Data-collecting investigators may be asked to answer questions when others try to use their data.

Scientists report that receiving more citations would be an important motivator for publicly archiving their data [Tenopir].

Several studies across several disciplines have found an association between data availability and number of citations recieved by a publication [cite studies below]. This evidence has been <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10688057049876523086&amp;as_sdt=5,39&amp;sciodt=0,39&amp;hl=en">frequently referenced</a>, including in new policies that encourage and require data archiving [<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10688057049876523086&amp;as_sdt=5,39&amp;sciodt=0,39&amp;hl=en">http://datadryad.org/jdap</a>]. It is important, therefore, to continue to strive for an accurate estimate of possible citation benefit.

The present study hopes to improve previous estimates in several ways. First, the present study is large enough to include many key covariates that may have conflated estimates of citation boost in previous, smaller studies: Number of authors, author publication experience, institution, open access availability, and subject area. Second, the current analysis estimates how citation boost levels may change over time. Third, the current analysis includes evidence on the number of citations that may be due to data reuse.

Gene expression microarray data provides a useful environment for the investigation: despite being valuable for reuse [Dudley] and well-supported by data sharing standards and infrastructure [Barrett], fewer than half of the studies that collect this data make it publicly available [Ochsner, Piwowar 2011].



## Methods

### Citations to gene expression microarray studies

#### Identification of relevant studies

<!--begin.rcode dfAttributes, echo=FALSE
dfAttributes = read.csv("data/PLoSONE2011_rawdata.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=F)
end.rcode-->

The primary analysis in this paper examines the citation count of a gene expression microarray experiment, relative to availability of the experiment's data.

The sample of microarray experiments used in the current analysis was previously determined (Piwowar 2011 PLoS ONE, data from Piwowar 2011 Dryad).  Briefly, a full-text query uncovered papers with keywords associated with relevant wet-lab methods.  The full-text query had been characterized with high precision (90%, 95% confidence interval 86% to 93%) and a moderate recall (56%, 52% to 61%) for this task.  Running the query in PubMed Central, HighWire Press, and Google Scholar revealed <!--rinline dim(dfAttributes)[1] --> distinct gene expression microarray papers.  The papers were published between 2000 and 2009.

The current analysis retained papers published from 2001 through 2009.


#### Assessment of data availability

The independent variable of interest in this analysis is the availability of gene expression microarray data.  Data availability had been previously determined for our sample articles in Piwowar 2011, so we directly reused that dataset [Piwowar Dryad 2011].  This study limited its data hunt to just the two predominant gene expression microarray databases: NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and EBI's ArrayExpress.

"An earlier evaluation found that querying GEO and ArrayExpress with article PubMed identifiers located a representative 77% of all associated publicly available datasets [Piwowar 2010]. [We] used the same method for finding datasets associated with published articles in this study: [we] queried GEO for links to the PubMed identifiers in the analysis sample using the “pubmed_gds [filter]” and queried ArrayExpress by searching for each PubMed identifier in a downloaded copy of the ArrayExpress database. Articles linked from a dataset in either of these two centralized repositories were considered to have [publicly available data] for the endpoint of this study, and those without such a link were considered not to have [available] data." [Piwowar 2011]

#### Study attributes

Piwowar 2011 includes 124 attributes for each of the gene expression microarray studies in our sample.  The subset of attributes previously shown or suspected to correlate with citation rate were included in the current analysis:

#### Citation data

This study required citation counts for thousands of articles identified through PubMed IDs. At the time of data collection, neither Thomson Reuter's Web of Science nor Google Scholar supported this type of query. It was (and is) supported by Elsevier's Scopus citation database. Alas, none of our affiliated institutions subscribed to Scopus. Scopus does not offer individual subscriptions, and a personal email to a Scopus Product Manager went unanswered.

One author (HAP) attempted to use the British Library's walk-in access of Scopus on its Reading Room computers during a trip overseas. Unfortunately, the British Library did not permit any method of electronic transfer of our PubMed identifier list onto the Reading Room computers, including internet document access, transferring a text file from a USB drive, or using the help desk as an intermediary (see related policies at http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/inrrooms/stp/cond/conditions.html). The Library was not willing to permit an exception in this case, and we were unwilling to manually type ten thousand PubMed identifiers into the Scopus search box in the Reading Room.
HAP eventually obtained Scopus access through a Research Worker agreement with Canada's National Research Library (NRC-CISTI), after being fingerprinted to obtain a police clearance certificate.

Although Scopus now has an API that would facilitate easy programmatic access to citation counts, at the time of data collection the authors were not aware of any way to retrieve Scopus data through researcher-developed computer programs.  We queried and exported Scopus citation data manually through interaction with the Scopus website. The Scopus website had a limit to the length of query and the number of citations that could be exported at once. To work within these restrictions we concatenated up to 500 PubMed IDs at a time into 22 queries, where each query took the form "PMID(1234) OR PMID(5678) OR ..."

end.rcode-->

Citation counts for <!--rinline dim(dfCitationsAttributesRaw)[1] --> papers were gathered from Scopus in November 2011. 



### Inline mentions of microarray dataset reuse

To derive an estimate of the reuse of data in GEO, we took advantage of the conventions for citing GEO datasets through accession numbers and GEO’s integration with PubMed and PubMed Central (PMC). 

Using PMC, we searched the full text of papers published between 2007 and 2010 for mention of one or more of the 2,711 accession numbers assigned to data series submitted to GEO in 2007. We excluded those papers that a) had author names in common with those who deposited the data (since the original authors would presumably have access to the data even in the absence of the archive) and b) mentioned an accession number without building upon the dataset. [Nature letter]

####Primary analysis of relationship between data availability and citation

The analysis included several multivariate linear regressions to evaluate the association between the public availability of a study's microarray data and the number of citations (after log transformation) it received. 

We began with a simple correlations between number of citations and other variables, using Pearson correlations for numberic variables and polyserial correlations for binary and factor covariates.  We also calculated correlations between data availability and other variables to investigate collinearity.

correlations_with_citations = sort(mycorr[,"nCitedBy.log"], dec=T)

# Correlations with data availability
correlations_with_data_avail = sort(mycorr[,"dataset.in.geo.or.ae"], dec=T)

end.rcode-->

The main analysis was run across all papers in the sample with many  covariates known or found (in the correlation analysis above) to correlate with citation rate.  Covariates included the date of publication, the journal which published the study, the journal impact factor, the journal citation halflife, the number of articles published by the journal, the journal's open access policy, whether the journal is considered a core clinical journal by MEDLINE, the number of authors of the study, the country of the corresponding author, the citation score of the institution of the corresponding author, the publishing experience of the first and last author, and the subject of the study itself.  

Publishing experience was characterized by the number of years since the author's first paper in PubMed, the number of papers they have published, and the number of citations they have received in PubMed Central, estimated using Authority clusters as described in [Piwowar 2011].  The subject of the study was characterized by whether the paper was classified as cancer, animals, or plants.  For more information on study attributes see [Piwowar 2011].

Citation count was log transformed to be consistent with prior literature.  Other count variables square-root transformed.  Continuous variables were represented with 3-part spines in the regression, using the rcs function in the R rms library.

The independent variable of interest was represented as a 0 or 1 in the regression, describing whether or not associated data had been found in the data repositories.  The relationship of the data availability variable to  citation count was described with 95% confidence intervals after raising the regression coefficient to the power of e (since the log of the number of citations was used in the regression).

Because publication date is such a strong correlate with both citation rate and data availability, we performed another analysis which stratified the sample by publication year, in addition to including publication date as a covariate.  Because the yearly regressions included fewer datapoints than the full regression, they supported a smaller number of covarites.  The yearly regressions included  date of publication, the journal which published the study, the journal impact factor, the journal's open access policy, the number of authors of the study, the citation score of the institution of the corresponding author, the previous number of PubMed Central citations recieved by the first and last author, whether the study was on cancer, and whether it used animals.

####Validation for automated method of detecting data availability

Our method of identifying which articles create gene expression microarray data made a nontrivial number of errors: about 10% of the articles it identified as creating gene expression microarray data do not in fact create gene expression datasets [cite].

The papers that are erroniously included in our subset to not create gene expression data, so they certainly don''t have associated archived datasets: all  erroniously included papers were automatically classified in the "no archived data" group. 

If it were true that these erroniously-included articles recieved many more or many fewer citations than other articles in the group, their inclusion could influence the findings of this study.

<!--begin.rcode manualAnnotationCreatedData, echo=FALSE
dfAnnotations = read.csv("data/Mendeley_annotated_250_of_11k.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=F)
# Get subset that has been annotated
dfAnnotationsAnnotated = subset(dfAnnotations, TAG.annotated == "11k-subset-reviewed")
# Merge together annotations with citation information
dfCitationsAnnotated = merge(dfAnnotationsAnnotated, dfCitations, by.x="pmid", by.y="PubMed.ID")

# Clean the data, get variables in useful formats
dfCitationsAnnotated$isCreated = factor(dfCitationsAnnotated$TAG.created)
dfCitationsAnnotated$nCitedBy = as.numeric(dfCitationsAnnotated$Cited.by)

dat.annotated.merged = merge(dfCitationsAnnotated, dfCitationsAttributes, by="pmid")
dat.annotated.merged.created = subset(dat.annotated.merged, isCreated==levels(isCreated)[1])
end.rcode-->

We took steps to verify our assumption that the influence of articles erroniously identified these mistakenly-included articles is in fact small.  We began by manually reviewed a random 226 of the 11k (get exact number) articles to identify those which we were assuming had created gene expression microarray data but in fact had not.

We compared the distribution of those with errors to those without, calculated whether they were statitically different, and ran a regression with the known-correct sample only.

<!--begin.rcode manualAnnotationCreatedStats

             , dat.annotated.merged.created)
end.rcode-->

####Subset analysis to compare findings with Piwowar et al 2007

We ran two modified analyses to attempt to reproduce the findings of [Piwowar 2007].  First, we used a subset with roughly the same inclusion criteria as Piwowar 2007 -- studies on cancer, with humans, published prior to 2003 -- and the same regression coefficients: publication date, impact factor, and whether the corresponding author's address is in the USA.

<!--begin.rcode RegressionAlaPrevStudy
  dat.subset.previous.study = subset(dfCitationsAttributes, (pubmed.year.published<2003) & (pubmed.is.cancer==1) & (pubmed.is.humans==1))

  myfitprev = lm(nCitedBy.log ~ 
      rcs(pubmed.date.in.pubmed, 3) +
      rcs(journal.impact.factor.tr, 3) +

      factor(dataset.in.geo.or.ae)
               , dat.subset.previous.study)
end.rcode-->

We followed that with a second regression that included several additional important covariates:  number of authors and number of previous citations by the last author.

####Complementary evidence of data reuse from citation context

Possible reuse in the published literature over the period 2005-2010 for datasets deposited in 2005.

We used ISI Web of Science to identify studies that used this method of data reuse attribution. For each dataset, we located the data collection article within ISI Web of Science and exported the list of all articles that cite this data collection article. This list of all citations was processed to subselect  150 random  citations, stratified by  the total  number of  times the data collection article had been cited.  The subselection of the ISI WoS results was saved as a  BibTeX file then uploaded to  the Mendeley group.

Manual review was performed for each instance of potential data reuse.  We located the article full text, read the relevant sections of the papers, and manually determined if the data from the associated dataset had been reused within the study.  Tags were applied to the Mendeley citation  to indicate data reuse, no data reuse, or data reuse ambiguous as well as a confidence level of high, medium, or low.  We also applied a tag indicating location of the attribution, and the search strategy used to find the instance of reuse. [Beginning to Track]

num.GEO.reused = dim(subset(dfTracking1k.GEO.subset, TAG.dataset.reused=="dataset reused"))[1]
annotated.prop = binconf(num.GEO.reused, num.GEO.total)
end.rcode-->

####Complementary evidence of data reuse from accession number attribution

Manually reviewing citation context does not scale well: we need a different way to identify large numbers of reuse instances.  A subset of reuses can be identfied by taking advantage of an attribution norm in some areas:  datasets are sometimes attributed directly, by mentioning the dataset identifier, or accession number, in the full-text of a research paper.  For obscure dataset  identifier strings, finding an identifier in a paper usually means the authors are a) talking about depositing the dataset or b) attributing dataset reuse.  We can distinguish these scenarious to a first approximation by looking at surname name overlap between investigators who deposited the dataset and authors on the paper that mentions the dataset, as described in [Beginning to Track.]  

We used the NCBI eUtils library and custom Python code to obtain a list of datasets deposited into GEO each year, then searched PubMed Central for each of these dataset identifiers. For each PubMed Central paper that refered to a dataset identifier, we recorded itsPubMed Central ID, year of publication, and author surnames.

PMC contains only a subset of papers recorded in PubMed.  To extrapolate from the number of hits we found in PubMed Central to the possible data reuses in all of PubMed we divided the number of hits we received in each publication year by the ratio of papers in PMC to papers in PubMed in this domain published that same year (same domain was measured as the number of articles indexed with the MeSH term “gene expression profiling”).  

<!--begin.rcode accessionRatios, echo=FALSE

dfPubmedPmcRatios = read.csv("data/pubmed_pmc_ratios.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=F)

# get a more exact ratio
dfPubmedPmcRatios$pmc_pmid_ratio = dfPubmedPmcRatios$num_pmc/dfPubmedPmcRatios$num_pubmed

cbind(with(dfPubmedPmcRatios, paste(year, ": ", round(pmc_pmid_ratio*100, 0), "%", sep="")))
end.rcode-->

We searched for hits until through 2010: 2011 has a dramatically lower proportion of papers in PubMed Central because the NIH archiving requirements permit a 12 month embargo.

The number of datasets deposited in GEO has grown over time.  To understand our findings on a per-dataset basis, we stratified reuse estimates by year of dataset submission and normalized our reuse findings by the number of datasets deposited that year:

## Results

### Primary analysis of relationship between data availability and citation

#### Description of cohort

We begin with articles that have been identified as collecting gene expression microarray data by automatic algorithms looking for keywords in article full text (Piwowar 2011).  

For this analysis of citation behaviour, we retain articles published from 2001 through 2009: <!--rinline dim(dfCitationsAttributes)[1] --> articles.

The composition of this sample is spread across XXX journals, with the top 12 journals accounting for XXX% of the papers.

<!--begin.rcode journalTable
sorted_journals = sort(table(dfCitationsAttributesRaw$pubmed_journal)/nrow(dfCitationsAttributesRaw), dec=T)[1:12]
gfm_table(cbind(names(sorted_journals), round(sorted_journals, 2)))
end.rcode-->

Collecting gene expression micorarray data became more popular over time: XX% of articles in our sample were published in 2001, compared to YY% in 2009.

<!--begin.rcode yearTable
gfm_table(table(dfCitationsAttributesRaw$pubmed_year_published)/nrow(dfCitationsAttributesRaw))

end.rcode-->


Searching for associated datasets in the GEO and ArrayExpress repository uncovered links between XXX% of papers in this sample and publicly available data.  
<!--begin.rcode sharing, fig.width=6, fig.height=6
table(dfCitationsAttributes$dataset.in.geo.or.ae.int)

gfm_table(table(dfCitationsAttributes$dataset.in.geo.or.ae.int)/nrow(dfCitationsAttributes))

end.rcode-->


Articles published more recently were more likely to have associated datasets.

<!--begin.rcode sharing_over_time, fig.width=6, fig.height=6, cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE

library(ggplot2)

df.long = melt(dfCitationsAttributes, measure.vars=c('pubmed.year.published'))
df.long.summary = ddply(df.long, .(variable, value), summarise, proportion=sum(dataset.in.geo.or.ae.int > 0) / length(dataset.in.geo.or.ae.int))

  theme_bw(base_size=16)

end.rcode-->

The articles in our sample were cited between 0 and 2640 times, with an average of 32 citations per paper and a median of 16.  


<!--begin.rcode sharingVCitations
summary(dfCitationsAttributes$nCitedBy)
end.rcode-->

Without accounting for any confounding factors, the mean number of citations between papers with available data and those without are the same, and there is little visible difference in the distribution of citations between these two groups.

<!--begin.rcode sharingVCitations_breakdown
with(dfCitationsAttributes, tapply(nCitedBy, dataset.in.geo.or.ae.int, summary))
end.rcode-->

<!--begin.rcode sharingVCitations_graph, echo=FALSE

ggplot(dfCitationsAttributesRaw, aes(1+nCitedBy, fill=factor(in_ae_or_geo))) + geom_density(alpha=0.2) + 
scale_fill_manual(name="",
                    breaks=c("0", "1"),
                    labels=c("data NOT available", "data available"), 
                    values=cbgRaw) + 
scale_x_log10(name="\nnumber of citations", breaks=citation_breaks+1, labels=citation_breaks) + 
#cbgFillPalette + 
cbgColourPalette + theme_bw(base_size=16)
end.rcode-->


The number of citations a paper has recieved is strongly correlated to the date it was published: older papers have had more time to accumulate citations.  Because data archiving was relatively infrequent for articles published earlier, a difference in citation behaviour may be confounded with publication date.

Indeed, we saw that for any given publication date, papers with associated data recieve more citations than those without.

<!--begin.rcode citationsByYearBySharing, echo=FALSE

median_citations_by_year = cbind(
dataset_not_available = with(subset(dfCitationsAttributes, dataset.in.geo.or.ae==0), tapply(nCitedBy, pubmed.year.published, median, na.rm=T))
,
dataset_available = with(subset(dfCitationsAttributes, dataset.in.geo.or.ae==1), tapply(nCitedBy, pubmed.year.published, median, na.rm=T))
)
round(median_citations_by_year, 0)

end.rcode-->
    
This difference in citation is not driven by outliers: as shown by the distribution of citations over time, the distribution of citations for older papers with available data is centered at a higher median than citations for papers without data available.

#### Correlations

Other factors have been previously shown to be correlated with citation rate, including number of authors, author experience, author institution, open access status, and subject area [cite]. 

Cited by correlations.  It must be remembered that these are univariate correlations and so should not be interpreted without additional context.  For example, most open access publications were published recently, so relative to non-open access publications in this sample they have had less time to accumulate citations.

<!--begin.rcode display_correlations_with_citations, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE
gfm_table(cbind(names(correlations_with_citations), round(correlations_with_citations, 2)))
end.rcode-->

Data availability correlations:

<!--begin.rcode univariate_dataavail, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE
gfm_table(cbind(names(correlations_with_data_avail), round(correlations_with_data_avail, 2)))
end.rcode-->

#### Multivariate regression
 
Multivariate regression analysis can be useful to identify the relationship between data availability and citation rate, independently of other variables.


<!--begin.rcode display_regressionAll, echo=FALSE

gfm_table(anova(fit_w_journal))
citation.boost.coefs.journal = calcCI.exp(fit_w_journal, "factor(dataset.in.geo.or.ae).L")
print(citation.boost.coefs.journal)

end.rcode-->

In this analysis, we found many of the variables were independently associated with citation rate, including number of authors, journal impact factor, the journal itself, the date of publication, the number of previous citations of the fist and last author, the number of previous publications of the last author, whether the paper was about animals or plants, and whether the data was made publicly available.

Estimate of the independent increase of citations due to data availability is  
<!--rinline 100*(citation.boost.coefs.journal$est-1) -->%
with 95% confidence intervals [<!--rinline 100*(citation.boost.coefs.journal$ciLow-1) -->%
, <!--rinline 100*(citation.boost.coefs.journal$ciHigh-1) -->% ]
(p=<!--rinline format(citation.boost.coefs.journal$p, nsmall = 2) -->)

Because publication date is such as strong correlate with both citation rate and data availability, we also ran regressions for each publication year individually (with a subset of the covariates).

The estimate of citation boost was different for different years of publication.

The estimates of citation boost for papers published in each year, with 95% confidence intervals:

<!--begin.rcode regressionEstimatesByYear
estimates_by_year
end.rcode-->

<!--begin.rcode display_regressionEstimatesByYear, echo=FALSE

ggplot(estimates_by_year, aes(x=year, y=est)) + geom_line() +

  scale_x_continuous(name="", breaks=seq(2001, 2009)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name='coefficient ratio\n', limits=c(0, 2.5)) + 
  theme_bw(base_size=16) +
  geom_hline(color="grey50", linetype="dashed", aes(yintercept=1))

end.rcode-->

###Validation for automated method of detecting data availability

Our method of identifying which articles create gene expression microarray data made a nontrivial number of errors: about 10% of the articles it identified as creating gene expression microarray data do not in fact create gene expression datasets [cite].

The papers that are erroniously included in our subset to not create gene expression data, so they certainly don''t have associated archived datasets: all  erroniously included papers were automatically classified in the "no archived data" group. 

If it were true that these erroniously-included articles recieved many more or many fewer citations than other articles in the group, their inclusion could influence the findings of this study.

To verify our assumption that the influence of these mistakenly-included articles is in fact small, we manually reviewed a random 226 of the 11k (get exact number) articles.

Of these manually reviewed articles, 206 did indeed create gene expression microarray data, and 20 did not (but satisfied the boolean-search query for other reasons).  

<!--begin.rcode percent
206/226
end.rcode-->

Examining the citations of the  20 articles that did not create gene expression data revealed that these studies were cited less often than those that did create data: a mean of 26 citations compared to a mean of 32 citations.  The overall distribution of citations for articles that did not create gene expression data is closer to zero than the distribution of citations for articles that did create gene expression data.

<!--begin.rcode manualAnnotationCreatedCitations
with(dfCitationsAnnotated, summary(nCitedBy~isCreated))
end.rcode-->


<!--begin.rcode display_manualAnnotationCreatedCitations, echo=FALSE
ggplot(dfCitationsAnnotated, aes(1+nCitedBy, fill=factor(isCreated))) + geom_density(alpha=0.2) + 
scale_fill_manual(name="",
                    values=cbgRaw, 
                    breaks=c("created-microarray-data", "created-microarray-data-not"),
                    labels=c("did collect microarray data", "did NOT collect microarray data")) + 
scale_x_log10(name="\nnumber of citations", breaks=citation_breaks+1, labels=citation_breaks) + 
#cbgFillPalette + 
cbgColourPalette + theme_bw(base_size=16)
end.rcode-->

This difference, however, was found to be not statisitically significantly different at the p<0.05 level, using either a t-test on the log of the citation counts or a Wilcoxon rank sum test on the raw citation counts.

<!--begin.rcode display_manualAnnotationCreatedStats
print(ttest_citedby)
print(ttest_log_citedby)
print(wilcox_citedby)
end.rcode-->

To confirm that the erroniously-included articles were not driving the findings about the citation relationship with data availability, we ran a multivariate regression analysis on the subsample of 206 articles that we manually determined did in fact generate gene expression microarray data.  The estimated effect is statistically significant and similar to the findings from the whole sample.

<!--begin.rcode display_manualAnnotationCreatedRegression
gfm_table(anova(annotated_merged_created))
calcCI.exp(annotated_merged_created, "factor(dataset.in.geo.or.ae).L")
end.rcode-->

### Subset analysis to compare findings with Piwowar et al 2007

These estimates of citation boost found in the multivariate regression were different from those found by (Piwowar et al 2007), even though both studies looked at publicly available gene expression microarray data. There are several possible reasons for this difference.  

First, Piwowar et al 2007 included only data from human cancer microarray trials published between 1999 and 2003 <check>, whereas the current study uses all gene expression microarray data studies in PubMed from 2001 through 2009. 

Second, because the Piwowar et al 2007 sample was small, the previous analysis included only a few possible covariates: publication date, journal impact factor, and country of the corresponding author.

We attempted to reproduce that environment in the current study to see if we would find more comperable results.

Limiting the current sample to datasets with MeSH terms "human" and "cancer" published from 2001 to 2003 retained 308 papers.  Running this subsample with  covariates from the Piwowar 2007 paper found a comperable estimate to the 2007 paper: a citation increase of 47% (95% confidence intervals of 6% to 103%).

<!--begin.rcode display_RegressionAlaPrevStudy
  gfm_table(anova(myfitprev))

  calcCI.exp(myfitprev, "factor(dataset.in.geo.or.ae).L")
end.rcode-->

How is did this estimate change when we included additional covariates?  The subsample of 308 papers was large enough to include a few additional covariates:  number of authors and citation history of the last author.  Including these covariates returned  a smaller estimated effect: 18% with a confidence interval that spanned a *loss* of 17% citations to a boost of 66%.  This range is too wide to be instructive, other than to note its top end is close to the previous rough estimates.

<!--begin.rcode display_RegressionAlaPrevStudyMoreCovariates

  gfm_table(anova(myfit_prev_more))

  calcCI.exp(myfit_prev_more, "factor(dataset.in.geo.or.ae).L")
end.rcode-->



### Complementary evidence of data reuse from citation context

To provide evidence on the proportion of the citation boost that may be caused by data reuse, we report the observed frequency with which papers that shared gene expression microarray data were cited in the context of data attribution.  Citations to papers that describe 100 datasets deposited into GEO in 2005 were collected using Web of Science: XXX total citations were found.  138 citations were randomly selected and manually reviewed.  



Of the <!--rinline num.GEO.total --> reviewed citations to articles with archived gene expression data, <!--rinline num.GEO.reused --> were in the context of data reuse
<!--rinline 100*(round(annotated.prop[1], 2)) -->%
with 95% confidence intervals [<!--rinline 100*(round(annotated.prop[2], 2)) -->%
, <!--rinline 100*(round(annotated.prop[3], 2)) -->% ]


### Complementary evidence of data reuse from accession number attribution


Finally, to provide evidence on the timeline of data attribution, we report  data reuse activity attributed through direct dataset mentions.

Studies with publicly available datasets received more citations than similar studies without available datasets, even after controlling for many variables known to influence citation rate.  We found the open data citation boost for this sample to be <!--rinline 100*(citation.boost.coefs.journal$est-1) -->% overall
(95% confidence interval: [<!--rinline 100*(citation.boost.coefs.journal$ciLow-1) -->%
to <!--rinline 100*(citation.boost.coefs.journal$ciHigh-1) -->%).  The specific boost depended heavily on the year the dataset was made available.  Datasets deposited in the last few years received no (or few) additional citations, while those deposited in 2004-2005 showed a clear boost of about 30% (confidence intervals 15% to 48%).  Older datasets also received a boost, though the confidence intervals were too wide to be very informative.

These new estimates are lower than those found by previous studies.  The most similar study, Piwowar 2007, found a citation boost of 69% (95% confidence intervals of 18 to 143%) for human cancer gene expression microarray studies published before 2003.  The high estimate of Piwowar 2007 could be because it analyzed particularly impactful datasets (clinically relevant, released early in the history of microarray analysis). Alternatively, the estimate be artifically high because the analysis in Piwowar 2007 omitted several important citation covariates (e.g. number of authors).  To investigate these possibilities we conducted a secondary analysis with our much larger dataset, roughly reproducing the inclusion criteria and methods for Piwowar 2007.  We found a similar citation boost to Piwowar 2007 with this restricted dataset and analysis (a citation increase of 47%, 95% CI 6% to 103%).  When we added two covariates to this analysis -- number of authors and citation history of last author -- the citation boost estimate decreased to 18% with wide confidence intervals (a *loss* of 17% citations to a boost of 66%).  This reinforces the importance of accounting for covariates to calculate accurate estimates, and the need for large samples to support full analysis: the 69% estimate is probably too high, even for its high-impact sample.

How can we interpret a citation boost of 10 to 30%?  Is it a large enough to motivate authors?  Future research is needed to understand author views on the trade-off between citation advantage (and other data archiving benefits) and perceived archiving costs.  For journals, a 10-30% citation boost is likely very motivating, given that journals currently fight for impact factor scores to two decimal places.  What about funders?  How is this citation boost related to more efficient and effective science?

A clear case can be made for data reuse contributing to a stellar scientific ROI [Nature letter], and at least part of an open data citation boost likely comes from data reuse attribution.  To verify that some of the data collection papers in this study were cited in the context of data reuse, we manually reviewed a random <!--rinline num.GEO.total --> sample of the citations in our analysis.  We found that <!--rinline 100*(round(annotated.prop[1], 2)) -->%
(95% CI: <!--rinline 100*(round(annotated.prop[2], 2)) -->%
to <!--rinline 100*(round(annotated.prop[3], 2)) -->%) of the citations were in the context of data reuse.  

Understanding data reuse patterns required a larger sample could easily be assembled through manual classification of citation context.  Instead, our explorations of data reuse patterns leveraged an alternate practice for data reuse attribution: direct mention of a dataset's name and identifier (traditionally an accession number) within the body of a full-text research article.  

Our results suggest the data collection team published almost all of its reuse papers within two years of the data being made publicly available.  In contrast, data reuse papers by third-party authors continued to accumulate rapidly 6 years after the data was made publicly available.  The level of third-party data use was high: for 100 datasets deposited in year 0, we estimate that 40 papers in PubMed reused a dataset by year 2, 100 by year 4, and more than 150 by year 7.  This data reuse curve held remarkably constant for data deposited between 2004 and 2009.  Microarray datasets made available in 2001 and 2002 were reused much more often, probably because of their ground-breaking roles.  The reuse growth trend for data deposited in 2003 has been slower, perhaps because 2003 data is not as ground-breaking as earlier data, and is probably less standards-compliant than later data.

These results suggest that the lower citation boost we observed for recent papers is due, at least in part, to a relatively short followup time.

Analysis of the accession number mentions revealed that data reuse was driven by a broad base of datasets: at least 21% of the datasets deposited in both 2003 and 2007 had been reused by third parties, and 17% of datasets from 2009.  We note these proportions are gross underestimates since they only include reuses we observed as accession number mentions in PubMed Central; no attempt has been made to extrapolate these distribution statistics to all of PubMed, or to reflect attributions through citations.  Further, many important instances of data reuse do not leave a trace in the published literature, such as those in education and training. Nonetheless, even these conservative estimates suggest that reuse finds value in a wide range of datasets, not simply a "very reusable" elite.

Data reuse, and the attendant efficiencies and discoveries, is a primary motivation for requiring that research data be made available.  Consequently, accurate measurement of data reuse is particularly important.  Future work can improve on the current study and previous studies by considering and integrating all methods of data use attribution.  This holistic effort would include identifying citations to the paper that describes the data collection, mentions of the dataset identifier itself -- whether in full text, the references section, or supplementary information -- citations to the dataset as a first-class research object, and even mentions of the data collection investigators in acknowledgement sections.  The citations and mentions would need classification based on context to ensure they are in the context of data reuse.

Estimates of data reuse could then be used to estimate the impact of policy decisions.  For example, do embargo periods decrease the level of data reuse?  Do restrictive or poorly articulated licencing terms decrease data reuse?  Which types of data reuse are facilitate by robust data standards and which types are unaffected?

We note that while an open data citation boost is likely largely driven by citation for data reuse, open data may directly or indirectly inspire citations for other reasons as well.  The literature on "Open Access Citation Benefit" has articulated several possible sources of OA citation boost, including Selection Bias and Early View ["Craig2007"].  Inspired by this work, we suggest several possible sources for an "Open Data Citation Benefit":

1. *Data Reuse*. Papers with available datasets can be used in more ways than papers without data, and therefore may receive additional attributions upon published data reuse.
1. *Credibility Signalling*. The credibility of research findings may be higher for research papers with available data. Such papers may be preferentially chosen background citations and/or the foundation of additional research.
1. *Increased Visibility*. Citing authors may be more likely to encounter a research project with available data. More artifacts associated with a research project gives the project a larger footprint, increasing the likelihood that someone finds an aspect of the research. Links from data to the research paper may also increase the search ranking of the research paper.
1. *Early View*. When data is made available before a paper is published, some citations may accrue earlier than otherwise because research methods and findings are encountered prior to paper publication.
1. *Selection Bias*. Authors may be more likely to publish data for papers they judge to be their best quality work, because they are most proud or confident in the results. ALTERNATIVELY, there is evidence that author self-selection bias may have a negative correlation with research quality in the case of Open Data [Wicherts 2011]: authors may be less willing to share details for their most important and visible research in order to maintain a competitive edge and avoid the upheaval of error detection. 

Importantly, almost all of these mechanisms are aligned with more efficient and effective science.  This means that fueling increased use, facilitated credibility determination, earlier access, improved discoverability, and a focus on best work through data availability is good for both investigators and the science community as a whole.  To address the main citation-related conflicting incentive, withholding data that might be important for finding weaknesses or faults, may require mandates.  Or, instead, perhaps the research community will quickly learn to associate withheld data with poor quality research.

Although the estimated citation boost in the current study is consistent with observed data reuse alone, other sources may also have contributed.  Further work, with additional data, will be needed to understand the relative contributions from each source.  For example, analyses within the pubication output of a sample of data-collecting authors could support measurement of selection bias.  Observing search behaviour of researchers, and the returned search hit results, could provide evidence of increased visibility due to data availability.  Hypothetical examples could be provided to authors to determine whether they would be systematically more likely to cite a paper with available data in situations where they are considering the credibility of the findings.

As evaluators move away from assessing research based on journal impact factor and toward article-level metrics, post-publication metrics rates will become icreasingly important indicators of research impact.  This study and associated work clearly demonstrates that improvements in tools and practice are needed to make impact tracking easier and more accurate, for day-to-day analysis as well as studies like this.  Researchers and research tools need libre access to the full-text of the research literature to support sophisticated text mining.  Citation databases are key building blocks of discovery: researchers need access to the services, and also to the code that support the services so they are empowered to add missing features.  Practice needs improvement too.  Currently data attribution practices are nonstandard, which inevitably leads to confusion and undercounting. 

Future work is needed to assess other important metrics of reuse, beyond citation.  The impact on practitioners, education, data journalism, and industry research are not captured by attibution patterns in the scientific literature.  Altmetrics indicators uncover discussions in social social media, syallabi, patents, and theses: analyzing such indicators for datasets would provide valuable evidence of reuse beyond the scientific literature.  

It is important to remember that the primary rationale for making research data broadly available has nothing to do with evaluation metrics: full description of experimental process and findings is a tenant of science and publicly-funded science is a public resource [http://www.nature.com/news/open-your-minds-and-share-your-results-1.10895].  Nonetheless, robust evidence of personal benefit will help as science transitions to a culture that simply expects data.

## Abstract (hasn't been updated)

### Background
Attribution upon reuse of scientific data is important to reward data creators and document the provenance of research findings.  In many fields, data attribution commonly takes the form of citation to the paper that described the primary data collection.  Previous studies have found that papers with publicly available datasets do indeed receive a higher number of citations than similar studies without available data.  However, previous studies were relatively small and did not control for many variables known to predict citation rate.  In this analysis we look at citation rates while controlling for many known citation predictors, and investigate whether the estimated citation boost is consistent with evidence of data reuse.

### Methods and Results
In a multivariate linear regression on <!--rinline dim(dfCitationsAttributesRaw)[1] --> studies that created gene expression microarray data, we found that studies with data in centralized public repositories received 
<!--rinline 100*(citation.boost.coefs.journal$est-1) -->%
(95% confidence interval: [<!--rinline 100*(citation.boost.coefs.journal$ciLow-1) -->%
to <!--rinline 100*(citation.boost.coefs.journal$ciHigh-1) -->%)
more citations than similar studies without available data.  Date of publication, journal impact factor, journal citation half-life, journal size, number of authors, first and last author number of previous publications and citations, corresponding author country, institution citation mean score, and study topic were included as covariates.  A small independent investigation of citations to microarray studies with publicly available data found that about 
<!--rinline 100*(round(annotated.prop[1], 2)) -->%
(95% CI: <!--rinline 100*(round(annotated.prop[2], 2)) -->%
to <!--rinline 100*(round(annotated.prop[3], 2)) -->%, 
n=<!--rinline num.GEO.total -->)
of citations to those studies were in the context of data reuse attribution.

### Discussion
This analysis reveals a modest but substantiated boost in data citation rates across a wide selection of studies that made their data publicly available.  Though modest, the impact represented by these data attributions should not be underestimated: attribution in the context of data reuse demonstrates a real and demonstrable contribution to subsequent research.
