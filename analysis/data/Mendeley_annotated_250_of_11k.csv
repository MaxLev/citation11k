11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that controls expression of inflammatory genetic networks. Although the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway is crucial for mediating cellular TNF responses, the complete spectrum of NF-kappaB-dependent genes is unknown. In this study, we used a tetracycline-regulated cell line expressing an NF-kappaB inhibitor to systematically identify NF-kappaB-dependent genes. A microarray data set generated from a time course of TNF stimulation in the presence or absence of NF-kappaB signaling was analyzed. We identified 50 unique genes that were regulated by TNF (Pr(F)<0.001) and demonstrated a change in signal intensity of+/-3-fold relative to control. Of these, 28 were NF-kappaB-dependent, encoding proteins involved in diverse cellular activities. Quantitative real-time PCR assays of eight characterized NF-kappaB-dependent genes and five genes not previously known to be NF-kappaB-dependent (Gro-beta and-gamma, IkappaBepsilon, interleukin (IL)-7R, and Naf-1) were used to determine whether they were directly or indirectly NF-kappaB regulated. Expression of constitutively active enhanced green fluorescent.NF-kappaB/Rel A fusion protein transactivated all but IL-6 and IL-7R in the absence of TNF stimulation. Moreover, TNF strongly induced all 12 genes in the absence of new protein synthesis. High probability NF-kappaB sites in novel genes were predicted by binding site analysis and confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show the endogenous IkappaBalpha/epsilon, Gro-beta/gamma, and Naf-1 promoters directly bound NF-kappaB/Rel A in TNF-stimulated cells. Together, these studies systematically identify the direct NF-kappaB-dependent gene network downstream of TNF signaling, extending our knowledge of biological processes regulated by this pathway.",,"; file:15722553 Oligonucleotide Probe-based Microarray—Hu95Av2 GeneChip (Af-fymetrix Inc, Santa Clara, CA) containing 12,626 sequenced human genes was hybridized according to the manufacturer’s recommenda- tions and washed using both non-stringent (1 M NaCl, 25 °C) and stringent (1 M NaCl, 50 °C) conditions prior to staining with phyco- erythrin streptavidin (10 g/ml final).

We performed a systematic and refined quantification of the absolute expression patterns of 16 genes coding for thioredoxin- and glutathione-dependent redox system components. Quantifications were performed to examine the response to oxidants, to sudden temperature upshifts and in association with metabolic changes accompanying culture growth and to explore the contribution of mRNA decay rates to the differences observed in basal expression levels. Collectively, these quantifications show (i) vast differences in the steady-state amounts of the investigated transcripts, cTPxI being largely overexpressed compared with GPX1 during the exponential phase and GPX2 beyond this growth stage; (ii) drastic changes in the relative abundance of the transcripts in response to oxidants and heat shock; and (iii) a unique temporal expression profile for each transcript as cells proceed from exponential to stationary growth phase, yet with some general trends such as maximal or near-maximal basal amounts of most mRNA species at early growth stages when glucose concentration is high and cells are actively growing. Moreover, the results indicate that (i) the half-lives of the investigated transcripts are longer and distributed within a narrower range than previously reported global mRNA half-lives and (ii) transcriptional initiation may play an important role in modulating the significant alterations that most mRNAs exhibit in their steady-state levels along with culture growth.",,; file:15222878,10.1042/BJ20040851,:Users/hpiwowar/Dropbox/TrackingDataReuse/citation benefit in 11k study/full text and detailed citation history of subsample/15222878.pdf:pdf,,1470-8728,The Biochemical journal,"11k-subset-reviewed,Fungal,Fungal: metabolism,Fungal: physiology,Gene Expression Regulation,Genetic,Genetic: physiology,Glutathione,Glutathione: physiology,Heat-Shock Proteins,Heat-Shock Proteins: genetics,Messenger,Messenger: metabolism,Oxidation-Reduction,Oxidative Stress,Oxidative Stress: physiology,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Polymerase Chain Reaction: methods,RNA,Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins,Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins: genetics,Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins: physiology,Saccharomyces cerevisiae: genetics,Saccharomyces cerevisiae: growth \& development,Saccharomyces cerevisiae: metabolism,Thioredoxins,Thioredoxins: metabolism,Transcription,created-microarray-data-not","11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data-not",October,Pt 1,139--147,15222878,,{\^{}\^{}10024\^{}\^{} Absolute transcript levels of thioredoxin- and glutathione-dependent redox systems in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: response to stress and modulation with growth.},http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1134052\&tool=pmcentrez\&rendertype=abstract,383,2004

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"To identify genes involved in breast tumorigenesis, we applied the retroviral LoxP-Cre system to a nontumorigenic mouse mammary epithelial cell line NOG8 to create random chromosome deletion/translocation. We found that the disruption of one allele of Smyd4 (SET and MYND domain containing 4) gene through chromosome translocation led to tumorigenesis. The expression of Smyd4 was markedly decreased in tumor cells. Re-expression of Smyd4 resulted in growth suppression of tumor cells and inhibition of tumor formation in nude mice. Furthermore, the RNA interference-mediated suppression of Smyd4 expression in human MCF10A mammary epithelial cells caused their growth in soft agar. Microarray studies revealed that platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha polypeptide (Pdgfr-alpha) was highly expressed in tumor cells compared with NOG8 cells. Re-expression of Smyd4 significantly reduced the expression of Pdgfr-alpha in tumor cells. In human breast cancers, reverse transcription-PCR results revealed that Smyd4 expression was totally silenced in 2 of 10 specimens. These findings indicate that Smyd4, as a potential tumor suppressor, plays a critical role in breast carcinogenesis at least partly through inhibiting the expression of Pdgfr-alpha, and could be a novel target for improving treatment of breast cancer.",,"; file:19383909 In addition, the microarray data (data not shown here but in the Supplementary Data) indicates that the NOG8-derived tumors highly express Pdgfa and Pdgfb, which are the ligands of Pdgfr-a homodimer (31)",10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4097,:Users/hpiwowar/Dropbox/TrackingDataReuse/citation benefit in 11k study/full text and detailed citation history of subsample/19383909.pdf:pdf,,1538-7445,Cancer research,"11k-subset-reviewed,Breast Neoplasms,Breast Neoplasms: genetics,Breast Neoplasms: metabolism,Breast Neoplasms: pathology,Cell Growth Processes,Cell Growth Processes: genetics,Cell Line,Chromosomes,Gene Expression,Gene Silencing,Genes,Genetic,Human,Humans,Pair 17,Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha,Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha: biosynthesi,Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha: genetics,RNA Interference,Receptor,Translocation,Tumor,Tumor Suppressor,Tumor Suppressor Proteins,Tumor Suppressor Proteins: biosynthesis,Tumor Suppressor Proteins: genetics,created-microarray-data","11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data",May,9,4067--4072,19383909,,{\^{}\^{}10211\^{}\^{} Identification of Smyd4 as a potential tumor suppressor gene involved in breast cancer development.},http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19383909,69,2009

Following electrophoresis, the presence of two distinct bands (representing the 28S and 18S species of rRNA), with no or minimal smearing, confirmed the presence of undegraded RNA.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"The transcription factor FNR, the regulator of fumarate and nitrate reduction, regulates major changes as Escherichia coli adapts from aerobic to anaerobic growth. In an anaerobic glycerol/trimethylamine N-oxide/fumarate medium, the fnr mutant grew as well as the parental strain, E. coli K12 MG1655, enabling us to reveal the response to oxygen, nitrate, and nitrite in the absence of glucose repression or artifacts because of variations in growth rate. Hence, many of the discrepancies between previous microarray studies of the E. coli FNR regulon were resolved. The current microarray data confirmed 31 of the previously characterized FNR-regulated operons. Forty four operons not previously known to be included in the FNR regulon were activated by FNR, and a further 28 operons appeared to be repressed. For each of these operons, a match to the consensus FNR-binding site sequence was identified. The FNR regulon therefore minimally includes at least 103, and possibly as many as 115, operons. Comparison of transcripts in the parental strain and a narXL deletion mutant revealed that transcription of 51 operons is activated, directly or indirectly, by NarL, and a further 41 operons are repressed. The narP gene was also deleted from the narXL mutant to reveal the extent of regulation by phosphorylated NarP. Fourteen promoters were more active in the narP+ strain than in the mutant, and a further 37 were strongly repressed.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"The peroxide response transcriptional regulator, PerR, is thought to contribute to virulence of group A Streptococcus (GAS); however, the specific mechanism through which it enhances adaptation for survival in the human host remains unknown. Here, we identify a critical role of PerR-regulated gene expression in GAS phagocytosis resistance and in virulence during pharyngeal infection. Deletion of perR in M-type 3 strain 003Sm was associated with reduced resistance to phagocytic killing in human blood and by murine macrophages in vitro. The increased phagocytic killing of the perR mutant was abrogated in the presence of the general oxidative burst inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), a result that suggests PerR-dependent gene expression counteracts the phagocyte oxidative burst. Moreover, an isogenic perR mutant was severely attenuated in a baboon model of GAS pharyngitis. In competitive infection experiments, the perR mutant was cleared from two animals at 24 h and from four of five animals by day 14, in sharp contrast to wild-type bacteria that persisted in the same five animals for 28 to 42 d. GAS genomic microarrays were used to compare wild-type and perR mutant transcriptomes in order to characterize the PerR regulon of GAS. These studies identified 42 PerR-dependent loci, the majority of which had not been previously recognized. Surprisingly, a large proportion of these loci are involved in sugar utilization and transport, in addition to oxidative stress adaptive responses and virulence. This finding suggests a novel role for PerR in mediating sugar uptake and utilization that, together with phagocytic killing resistance, may contribute to GAS fitness in the infected host.

This 2 to 1 dosage relationship provides a unique system for studying the additivity of gene expression levels in reciprocal hybrids. A combination of microarray profiling and allele-specific expression analysis was performed using RNA isolated from endosperm tissues of maize (Zea mays) inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and their reciprocal hybrids at two developmental stages, 13 and 19 d after pollination. The majority of genes exhibited additive expression in reciprocal hybrids based on microarray analyses. However, a substantial number of genes exhibited nonadditive expression patterns, including maternal like, paternal like, high parent like, low parent like, and expression patterns outside the range of the parental inbreds. The frequency of hybrid expression patterns outside of the parental range in maize endosperm tissue is much higher than that observed for vegetative tissues. For a set of 90 genes, allele-specific expression assays were employed to monitor allelic bias and regulatory variation. Eight of these genes exhibited evidence for maternally or paternally biased expression at multiple stages of endosperm development and are potential examples of differential imprinting.

Here we show that skeletal muscle-specific deletion of Mef2c in mice results in disorganized myofibers and perinatal lethality. In contrast, neither Mef2a nor Mef2d is required for normal skeletal muscle development in vivo. Skeletal muscle deficient in Mef2c differentiates and forms normal myofibers during embryogenesis, but myofibers rapidly deteriorate after birth due to disorganized sarcomeres and a loss of integrity of the M line. Microarray analysis of Mef2c null muscles identified several muscle structural genes that depend on MEF2C, including those encoding the M-line-specific proteins myomesin and M protein.

In addition, a direct effect of beta-amyloid on neurons has been also described. However, the precise mechanisms involved in the amyloid-induced neurotoxicity have been not yet definitely clarified.

We hypothesized that macrophages from individuals with different clinical manifestations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection would have distinct gene expression profiles and that polymorphisms in these genes may also be associated with susceptibility to TB. We measured gene expression levels of >38,500 genes from ex vivo Mtb-stimulated macrophages in 12 subjects with 3 clinical phenotypes: latent, pulmonary, and meningeal TB (n = 4 per group). After identifying differentially expressed genes, we confirmed these results in 34 additional subjects by real-time PCR. We also used a case-control study design to examine whether polymorphisms in differentially regulated genes were associated with susceptibility to these different clinical forms of TB. We compared gene expression profiles in Mtb-stimulated and unstimulated macrophages and identified 1,608 and 199 genes that were differentially expressed by >2- and >5-fold, respectively. In an independent sample set of 34 individuals and a subset of highly regulated genes, 90\% of the microarray results were confirmed by RT-PCR, including expression levels of CCL1, which distinguished the 3 clinical groups. Furthermore, 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CCL1 were found to be associated with TB in a case-control genetic association study with 273 TB cases and 188 controls. To our knowledge, this is the first identification of CCL1 as a gene involved in host susceptibility to TB and the first study to combine microarray and DNA polymorphism studies to identify genes associated with TB susceptibility.

Previous work identified RHA1 genes encoding multiple isozymes for most of the seven steps of the biphenyl (BPH) pathway, provided evidence for coexpression of some of these isozymes, and indicated the involvement of some of these enzymes in the degradation of BPH, ethylbenzene (ETB), and PCBs. To investigate the expression of these isozymes and better understand how they contribute to the robust degradative capacity of RHA1, we comprehensively analyzed the 9.7-Mb genome of RHA1 for BPH pathway genes and characterized the transcriptome of RHA1 growing on benzoate (BEN), BPH, and ETB. Sequence analyses revealed 54 potential BPH pathway genes, including 28 not previously reported. Transcriptomic analysis with a DNA microarray containing 70-mer probes for 8,213 RHA1 genes revealed a suite of 320 genes of diverse functions that were upregulated during growth both on BPH and on ETB, relative to growth on the control substrate, pyruvate. By contrast, only 65 genes were upregulated during growth on BEN. Quantitative PCR assays confirmed microarray results for selected genes and indicated that some of the catabolic genes were upregulated over 10,000-fold. Our analysis suggests that up to 22 enzymes, including 8 newly identified ones, may function in the BPH pathway of RHA1. The relative expression levels of catabolic genes did not differ for BPH and ETB, suggesting a common regulatory mechanism.

Peyer's patches in the jejunum contain lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, villous epithelium, and specialized follicle-associated epithelium. Little is known about the mechanisms and processes by which cells of the Peyer's patches discriminate food nutrients and commensal microflora from pathogenic microbiota. We hypothesize that the jejunal Peyer's patches express genes that mediate and regulate its essential functions. Expression patterns of approximately 2600 cDNAs from a porcine Peyer's patch subtracted library were examined by microarray profiling. Individual mRNAs of interest were further examined by quantitative RT-PCR. Innate immunity-associated genes, including complement 3 and lysozyme, and the genes for epithelial chloride channel and trappin 1 were highly expressed by jejunal Peyer's patch in both juvenile and adult pigs. The growth- and apoptosis-associated genes CIDE-B, GW112, and PSP/Reg I (pancreatic stone protein or regenerating gene) were differentially expressed in juvenile pig Peyer's patches. Many sequences which were highly expressed in jejunal Peyer's patches have previously been described with functions in epithelial cells.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Physiological activation of the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system (HNS) by dehydration results is a massive release of vasopressin (VP) from the posterior pituitary. This is accompanied by a functional remodeling of the HNS. In this study we used cDNA arrays in an attempt to identify genes that exhibit differential expression in the hypothalamus following dehydration. Our study revealed nine candidate genes, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a putative novel secretory product of HNS worthy of further analysis. In situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry confirmed that IL-6 is robustly expressed in the supraoptic (SON) and the paraventricular (PVN) nuclei of the hypothalamus. By double staining immunofluorescence we showed that IL-6 is largely co-localized with VP in the SON and PVN. In situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry, and Western blotting all revealed IL-6 up-regulation in the SON and PVN following dehydration, thus validating the array data. The same dehydration stimulus resulted in an increase in IL-6 immunoreactivity in the axons of the internal zone of the median eminence and a marked reduction in IL-6-like material in the posterior pituitary gland.

Recent studies demonstrate that VLPs bind to dendritic cells and induce the expression of antiviral cytokines such as interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IFN-gamma. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of VLPs on HIV-1 replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), CD4+ T cells, and macrophages.

Soluble factor(s) released by PBMCs and macrophages on VLPs treatment inhibited HIV-1 replication. To determine the inhibitory factors, DNA microarray analysis was performed using VLP-treated PBMCs and macrophages. VLPs induced the genes associated with IFN induction, immune responses, and antiviral responses, among with the recently described cytokine IL-27. Subsequently, IL-27 was found to be a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication in PBMCs, CD4+ T cells, and macrophages.

Specialized functions of lymphatics suggest differences in the molecular composition of the lymphatic and blood vascular endothelium. However, the extent to which the two cell types differ is still unclear, and few molecules that are truly specific to lymphatic endothelial cells have been identified to date. We have isolated primary lymphatic and blood microvascular endothelial cells from human skin by immunoselection with the lymphatic marker LYVE-1 and demonstrate that the two cell lineages express distinct sets of vascular markers and respond differently to growth factors and extracellular matrix. Comparative microarray analysis of gene-expression profiles revealed a number of unique molecular properties that distinguish lymphatic and blood vascular endothelium. The molecular profile of lymphatic endothelium seems to reflect characteristic functional and structural features of the lymphatic capillaries. Classification of the differentially expressed genes into functional groups revealed particularly high levels of genes implicated in protein sorting and trafficking, indicating a more active role of lymphatic endothelium in uptake and transport of molecules than previously anticipated.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"MOTIVATION: In microarray studies it is often of interest to identify upstream transcription control pathways mediating observed changes in gene expression. The Transcription Element Listening System (TELiS) combines sequence-based analysis of gene regulatory regions with statistical prevalence analyses to identify transcription-factor binding motifs (TFBMs) that are over-represented among the promoters of up- or down-regulated genes. Efficiency is maximized by decomposing the problem into two steps: (1) a priori compilation of prevalence matrices specifying the number of putative binding sites for a variety of transcription factors in promoters from all genes assayed by a given microarray, and (2) real-time statistical analysis of pre-compiled prevalence matrices to identify TFBMs that are over- or under-represented in promoters of differentially expressed genes. The interlocking JAVA applications namely, PromoterScan and PromoterStats carry out these tasks, and together constitute the TELiS database for reverse inference of transcription factor activity. RESULTS: In two validation studies, TELiS accurately detected in vivo activation of NF-kappaB and the Type I interferon system by HIV-1 infection and pharmacologic activation of the glucocorticoid receptor in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The population-based statistical inference underlying TELiS out-performed conventional statistical tests in analytic sensitivity, with parametric studies demonstrating accurate identification of transcription factor activity from as few as 20 differentially expressed genes. TELiS thus provides a simple, rapid and sensitive tool for identifying transcription control pathways mediating observed gene expression dynamics.",,"; file:15374858 Scanned images were analyzed for up-regulated genes using Affymetrix Microarray Suite v5 software with default analysis parameters (paired comparison of each donor’s hydrocortisone-treated cells with parallel untreated cells).

We observed 17 additional sites that responded in a lexA-dependent manner and a large number of genes that were upregulated in a lexA-independent manner although upregulation in this manner was generally not more than twofold. In addition, several transcripts were either downregulated or degraded following UV irradiation. These newly identified UV-responsive genes are discussed with respect to their possible roles in cellular recovery following exposure to UV irradiation.",,"; file:11333217 Microarray procedures: Relative mRNA levels were deter- minedby parallel two-color hybridization tocDNAmicroarraysrepresenting 4101 open reading frames (ORFs) representing 95.5\% of E. coli ORFs according to Blattner et al.

Existing experimental evidence clearly demonstrates that placental trophoblasts play an important role in regulating immunologic/inflammatory responses at the maternal-fetal interface. We used a well-developed gene expression array to examine in greater detail the physiologic response of trophoblast-like choriocarcinoma cells to a model immunologic 'challenge.' We co-cultured PHA-activated or resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with the human choriocarcinoma cell line JAR for time periods ranging from 2 to 18 h. Messenger RNA expression in the JAR cells was then assessed using a 21,329-gene microarray and novel biostatistical analyses that we have previously published. Patterns of differential gene expression were assessed using a commercial pathway analysis software program. Differences in gene expression between JAR cells cultured with activated PBMC (experimental samples) and JAR cells cultured with resting PBMC (control samples) were seen only at the 2h time point. That is, multiple genes were transcribed in JAR cells in response to activated PBMC, but expression levels of the genes had all returned to baseline by 6h. Molecular modeling demonstrated that the differentially expressed genes were largely associated with cell growth and differentiation. This model was confirmed by noting a two-fold increase in CD10/neutral endopeptidase expression (a marker for cell differentiation) in JAR cells incubated with media from activated PBMC compared with JAR cells incubated with resting PBMC. These findings support the hypothesis that there is a delicate immunologic milieu at the maternal-fetal interface that must be maintained. Immunologic/inflammatory challenge at the maternal-fetal interface is compensated by cellular mechanisms that work to reduce inflammation and rapidly restore immunologic balance.",,"; file:15063633 The arrays used in these experiments were developed at the Oklahoma Medical ResearchFoundation Microarray Core Facility in collaboration with Qiagen Operon.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Streptococcus pneumoniae, one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in humans, faces a range of potentially acidic conditions in the middle and late stages of growth in vitro, in diverse human fluids during the infection process, and in biofilms present in the nasopharynx of carriers. S. pneumoniae was shown to develop a weak acid tolerance response (ATR), where cells previously exposed to sublethal pHs (5.8-6.6) showed an increased survival rate of up to one order of magnitude after challenge at the lethal pH (4.4, survival rate of 10(-4)). Moreover, the survival after challenge of stationary phase cells at pH 4.4 was three orders of magnitude higher than that of cells taken from the exponential phase, due to the production of lactic acid during growth and increasing acidification of the growth medium until stationary phase. Global expression analysis after short-term (5, 15 and 30 min, the adaptation phase) and long-term (the maintenance phase) acidic shock (pH 6.0) was performed by microarray experiments, and the results were validated by real-time RT-PCR. Out of a total of 126 genes responding to acidification, 59 and 37 were specific to the adaptation phase and maintenance phase, respectively, and 30 were common to both periods. In the adaptation phase, both up- and down-regulation of gene transcripts was observed (38 and 21 genes, respectively), whereas in the maintenance phase most of the affected genes were down-regulated (34 out of 37). Genes involved in protein fate (including those involved in the protection of the protein native structure) and transport (including transporters of manganese and iron) were overrepresented among the genes affected by acidification, 8.7 and 24.6 \% of the acid-responsive genes compared to 2.8 \% and 9.6 \% of the genome complement, respectively.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data-not,"The prognosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is affected by early metastases and local tumour invasion beyond surgical margins. Gene expression profiling in pancreatic cancer tissue is complicated due to the high amount of RNAses being present in human tissue and that of suitable models. In order to demonstrate early metastases, the models should take into account the anatomical environment of the tumour. Using the orthotopic transplantation of pancreatic tumour cells in SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice, these interactions are taken into consideration. In order to identify genes associated with local tumour invasion and metastases in ductal pancreatic cancer, we investigated a human pancreatic tumour cell line derived from an orthopic pancreatic tumour model in SCID mice. Differential gene expression was performed on the basis of microarray technique. The human MiaPaca-2 cell line was implanted orthotopically in SCID mice. Transcriptional profiling was performed on fresh frozen tissue derived from the primary tumour, the tumour invasion front and the liver metastases. Differentially expressed genes were identified using statistical analyses, and were validated with external databases and with immunohistochemistry. A total of 1066 of 14 500 genes were significantly differentially expressed. Comparing the primary tumour with the tumour invasion front, there were 614 statistically significant up- and 348 downregulated genes. Twenty-five statistically significant up- and 181 downregulated genes were identified comparing the liver metastases with the primary tumour. Eight genes (PAI-1, BNIP3l, VEGF, NSE, RGS4, HSP27, GADD45A, PTPN14) were chosen and validated in a semi-quantitative immunohistochemical analysis, which revealed a positive correlation to the array data. Overrepresentation analyses revealed a total of 66 significantly regulated pathways associated with cell proliferation, cell stress, cell communication metabolic and cytokine function. In conclusion, model marker genes for local invasion and liver metastases can be identified using transcriptional profiling in the SCID mouse. Overrepresentation analysis secures a good and fast overview about the significantly regulated genes and can assign genes to certain pathways. These marker genes can be related to the apoptotic cascade, angiogenesis and cell interaction.",,; file:17940512,10.1038/sj.bjc.6604031,:Users/hpiwowar/Dropbox/TrackingDataReuse/citation benefit in 11k study/full text and detailed citation history of subsample/17940512.pdf:pdf,,0007-0920,British journal of cancer,"11k-subset-reviewed,Animal,Animals,Biological,Biological: genetics,Cell Line,Databases,Disease Models,Factual,Female,Gene Expression Profiling,Humans,Immunohistochemistry,Liver Neoplasms,Liver Neoplasms: genetics,Liver Neoplasms: metabolism,Liver Neoplasms: secondary,Male,Mice,Neoplasm Invasiveness,Neoplasm Transplantation,Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis,Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis: methods,Pancreatic Neoplasms,Pancreatic Neoplasms: genetics,Pancreatic Neoplasms: metabolism,Pancreatic Neoplasms: pathology,SCID,Tumor,Tumor Markers,created-microarray-data-not","11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data-not",November,10,1432--1440,17940512,,{\^{}\^{}10193\^{}\^{} Gene expression profiling of liver metastases and tumour invasion in pancreatic cancer using an orthotopic SCID mouse model.},http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2360231\&tool=pmcentrez\&rendertype=abstract,97,2007

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"The purpose of this study was to determine (1) the transcriptional program elicited by exposure to three estrogen receptor (ER) agonists: 17 alpha-ethynyl estradiol (EE), genistein (Ges), and bisphenol A (BPA) during fetal development of the rat testis and epididymis; and (2) whether very low dosages of estrogens (evaluated over five orders of magnitude of dosage) produce unexpected changes in gene expression (i.e., a non-monotonic dose-response curve). In three independently conducted experiments, Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed (sc) with 0.001-10 microg EE/kg/day, 0.001-100 mg Ges/kg/day, or 0.002-400 mg BPA/kg/day. While morphological changes in the developing reproductive system were not observed, the gene expression profile of target tissues were modified in a dose-responsive manner. Independent dose-response analyses of the three studies identified 59 genes that are significantly modified by EE, 23 genes by Ges, and 15 genes by BPA (out of 8740), by at least 1.5 fold (up- or down-regulated). Even more genes were observed to be significantly changed when only the high dose is compared with all lower doses: 141, 46, and 67 genes, respectively. Global analyses aimed at detecting genes consistently modified by all of the chemicals identified 50 genes whose expression changed in the same direction across the three chemicals. The dose-response curve for gene expression changes was monotonic for each chemical, with both the number of genes significantly changed and the magnitude of change, for each gene, decreasing with decreasing dose. Using the available annotation of the gene expression changes induced by ER-agonist, our data suggest that a variety of cellular pathways are affected by estrogen exposure. These results indicate that gene expression data are diagnostic of mode of action and, if they are evaluated in the context of traditional toxicological end-points, can be used to elucidate dose-response characteristics.",,"; file:15901920 Expression profiling. Our goal was to determine the gene expressionprofile induced by agonists of the estrogen receptors, in estrogen-regulated tissues of the reproductive tract of the male, with the ultimate purpose of providing information that will be useful in establishing a gene-based screening assay.We chose to evaluate the testis and epididymis as a pool because they are two clear targets of estrogenic regulation. While we realize that this may result in loss of information about gene expression in one or the other organ, we believe that from a screening perspective we have taken the best approach because these organs contain considerable variation in the expression levels of the two ER isoforms and consequently have the potential to represent gene expression changes induced by activation of either isoform. Therefore, the testis and epididymis of at least five littermates were pooled, to yield a representative litter sample (biological replica) for analysis, and total RNAwas extracted using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Total RNAwas further purified by RNeasy kit (QIAGEN,Valencia CA).

Furthermore, whether NAI T cells serially differentiate into EFFE and then MEM cells (linear differentiation) or whether they concurrently differentiate into either EFFE or MEM cells (parallel differentiation) remains unresolved. We isolated NAI, EFFE, and MEM CD8(+) T cell subsets from human peripheral blood and analyzed their gene expression by using microarrays. We identified 156 genes that strongly differentiate NAI, EFFE, and MEM CD8(+) T cells; these genes provide previously unrecognized markers to help identify each cell type. Using several statistical approaches to analyze and group the data (standard heat-map and hierarchical clustering, a unique circular representation, multivariate analyses based on principal components, and a clustering method based on phylogenetic parsimony analysis), we assessed the lineage relationships between these subsets and showed that MEM cells have gene expression patterns intermediate between NAI and EFFE T cells. Our analysis suggests a common differentiation pathway to an intermediate state followed by a split into EFFE or MEM cells, hence supporting the parallel differentiation model. As such, conditions under which NAI T cells are activated may determine the magnitude of both EFFE and MEM cells, which arise subsequently. A better understanding of these conditions may be very useful in the design of future vaccine strategies to maximize MEM cell generation.",,"; file:15809420 Cell Isolation and Microarray Analysis.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Immune escape is an important reason why the immune system cannot control tumor growth, but how escape variants emerge during immunotherapy remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a new mechanism of tumor immune escape using an in vivo selection strategy. We generated a highly immune-resistant cancer cell line (P3) by subjecting a susceptible cancer cell line (P0/TC-1) to multiple rounds of in vivo immune selection. Microarray analysis of P0 and P3 revealed that vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) is up-regulated in the P3-resistant variant. Retroviral transfer of VCAM-1 into P0 significantly increased its resistance against a vaccine-induced immune response. Analysis of tumors showed a dramatic decrease in the number of tumor-infiltrating cluster of differentiation 8(+) (CD8(+)) T cells in the tumors expressing VCAM-1. In vitro transwell migration assays showed that VCAM-1 can promote the migration of CD8(+) T cells through its interaction with the alpha(4)beta(1) integrin. Site-directed mutagenesis of VCAM-1 at amino acid residues required for interaction with alpha(4)beta(1) integrin completely abolished the immune resistance conferred by VCAM-1 in vivo. Surface staining showed that most renal cell carcinomas (RCC) express VCAM-1, whereas an RCC that responded to vaccination was VCAM-1 negative. These data provide evidence that tumor expression of VCAM-1 represents a new mechanism of immune evasion and has important implications for the development of immunotherapy for human RCC.",,"; file:17308126 RNA sample preparation and microarray analysis.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Recent cloning technology has been demonstrated successfully using nuclear transfer (NT) techniques to generate embryonic stem (ES) cells. Mice can be cloned from adult somatic cells or ES cells by NT, and such cloned embryos can be used to establish new NT-ES cell lines. However, ES cells derived from parthenogenetic embryos show epigenetic disorders and low potential for normal differentiation unless used to produce subsequent generations of NT-ES lines. Thus, enucleated oocytes can initialize epigenetic modification, but the extent and efficacy of this remain unclear. In this study, our goal was to clarify why the contribution rate of ES cells derived from parthenogenetic embryos (pES) cells appears to improve after NT. We compared gene expression profiles between pES and NT-pES cell lines using DNA microarray analysis and allele-specific DNA methylation analysis. Although changes in expression level were observed for 4\% of 34,967 genes, only 81 (0.2\%) showed common changes across multiple cell lines. In particular, the expression level of a paternally expressed gene, U2af1-rs1, was significantly increased in all NT-pES cell lines investigated. The methylation status at the upstream differentially methylated region of U2af1-rs1 was also changed significantly after NT. This was observed in NT-pES cells, but also in conventionally produced NT-ES cells, which has never been reported previously. These results suggest that NT affects the epigenetic status of a few gene regions in common and that a change in the methylation status of U2af1-rs1 could be used as a genetic marker to investigate the effects of NT.",,"; file:18192228 DNA Microarray AnalysisThe CodeLink system (Mouse Whole Genome Array; Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, http://www.amersham.com) was used to determine and compare the expression levels of 36,000 genes in three normally fertilized ES cell lines, one pES cell line, two second-generation NT-pES cell lines, and two third-generation NT- pES cell lines.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Dendritic cells (DC) are central regulators of immunity. Signal-induced maturation of DCs is assumed to be the starting point for specific immune responses. To further understand this process, we analyzed the alteration of transcript profiles along the time course of CD40 ligand-induced maturation of human myeloid DCs by Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays covering >6800 genes. Besides rediscovery of genes already described as associated with DC maturation proving reliability of the methods used, we identified clusterin as novel maturation marker. Looking across the time course, we observed synchronized kinetics of distinct functional groups of molecules whose temporal coregulation underscores known cellular events during dendritic cell maturation. For example, an early-peaking wave of inflammatory chemokines was followed by a sustained increase of constitutive chemokines and accompanied by slow but continuous induction of survival proteins. After an immediate but transient induction of cytokine-responsive transcripts, there was an increased expression of a group of genes involved in not only the regulation of cytokine effects, but also of transcription in general.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"There is considerable interest in making multilayer films for various applications, among which are cell contacting biomaterials, allowing new opportunities to prepare functionalized biomaterials. In this study we have explored the capability of poly(sodium-4-styrene sulfonate)/poly(allylamine hydrochloride) polyelectrolyte multilayer films (PMFs) as functional coatings for human progenitor-derived endothelial cells (PDECs), since the latter are a potential source of endothelial-type cells to be used in bioartificial vascular substitutes. We performed investigations with PDECs derived from peripheral blood and characterized as endothelial cells. After forming a confluent monolayer on PMFs they were exposed to laminar pulsatile physiological shear stress. We investigated whether PDECs were able to withstand shear stress and to respond at the mRNA (microarray analysis) and protein levels (thrombomodulin and tissue factor functional activity), in comparison with collagen I and fibrin glue used as controls. After shear stress the PDECs remained spread on the substrates, with a resulting increase in the number of expressed genes. Considering the functional significance of our findings for the regulation of coagulation and fibrinolytic factors, mRNA tissue plasminogen activator and thrombomodulin, profibrinolytic and thrombin inhibiting respectively, were overexpressed in PDECs after 6h shear stress. von Willebrand factor showed down-regulation, while tissue factor was up-regulated. We can speculate that PMFs could favour anti-thrombogenic activity by PDECs because activated protein C generation, measuring thrombomodulin activity, was particularly high on PMFs, but unchanged after 6h shear stress. Thus, PMFs could represent suitable coatings able to provide functional surfaces for endothelialization with PDECs.",,"; file:19913644 2.5. mRNA expression: oligonucleotide microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR analysisAfter exposure to 6 h flow, cells were detached from glass slides coated with PMFs, collagen I or fibrin glue using a trypsin–EDTA solution (0.125\% trypsin and 12.5mMEDTA).

Microarray experiments In this study we employed the Human Focused Array, a membrane-based cDNA microarray containing 2700 different elements in duplicate, which can be accessed at http:// www.grc.nia.nih.gov/branches/rrb/dna/index/dnapubs.htm\#2. We used this human-focused cDNA array, as opposed to full chips, because the first generation, larger, commercially available “full” arrays were associated with significant hybridization problems. Furthermore, few, if any, well-characterized rat arrays were commercially available at the time. In contrast, we had extensive experience with the focused cDNA arrays for cross-species experiments, and we determined that the arrays were reliable for the study since the relatively long cDNAs used in these focused arrays allowed for good hybridization, even with occasional mismatches.",,:Users/hpiwowar/Dropbox/TrackingDataReuse/citation benefit in 11k study/full text and detailed citation history of subsample/17397968.pdf:pdf,,,Neurochem Int.,"11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data","11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data",,6,834--847,17397968,,{\^{}\^{}10000\^{}\^{} Microarray Analysis of Oxidative Stress Regulated Genes in Mesencephalic Dopaminergic Neuronal Cells: Relevance to Oxidative Damage in Parkinson’s Disease},,50,2007

Briefly, total RNA was extracted from the TCDD-treated cells and control AEC using an RNA extraction solution (Trizol). After Oligo-dT latex beads treatment, double stranded cDNA libraries were constructed from the mRNA of TCDD-treated cells and the control AEC using an oligo-dT primer with a T7-pro- moter sequence at the 5'-end. Biotin-labeled complemen- tary RNA was in vitro transcribed by T7 promoter using the cDNA libraries as template. The biotin-labeled RNA was fragmented. Each sample was hybridized to a separate oligonucleotide array(Affymetrix Human Genome U133A) for 16 hours at 45C, and then washed and stained with streptavidin phycoerythrin conjugate using Gene- Chip Fluidics. The arrays were scanned by a Gene-Array scanner using Affymetrix GeneChip Microarray Suite (MAS) 5.0 software for scanning and basic analysis.

One probe from the pair perfectly matches its tar- get sequence while the other contains a mismatch located at the center of the 25-mer sequence. This probe pairing design helps identify and subtract non-specific hybridiza- tion and background signal. For each probe pair, the MM signal was subtracted from the PM signal. The average of these differences was reflective of the level of expression of the gene. The global method of scaling/normalization was performed by MAS 5.0 software.

Here we performed microarray analysis on mRNA from purified lesional epidermal cells of patients with chronic plaque psoriasis and chronic atopic dermatitis, to investigate whether this is a general phenomenon for host defense proteins, and how specific it is for this class of molecules. Microarray data were confirmed on a selected set of genes by quantitative PCR and at the protein level by immunohistochemistry. We found overexpression of many antimicrobial proteins in keratinocytes from psoriatic skin compared with atopic dermatitis skin. Interestingly, we observed that markers of normal differentiation and the activated/hyperproliferative epidermal phenotype were expressed at equal levels. Chronic lesions of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis patients are remarkably similar with respect to cellular proliferation. We conclude that psoriatic epidermis expresses high levels of host defense proteins compared with atopic dermatitis epidermis, and this phenomenon appears to be specific for these proteins.

To elucidate molecular identities for these different properties, we compared gene expression profiles of neurons located in nodose ganglia (NG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in mice. Intraperitoneal administration of Alexa Fluor-488-conjugated cholera toxin B allowed enrichment for neurons projecting to the viscera. Fluorescent neurons in DRG (from T10 to T13) and NG were isolated using laser-capture microdissection. Gene expression profiles of these afferent neurons, obtained by microarray hybridization, were analyzed using multivariate spectral map analysis, significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) algorithm, and fold-difference filtering. A total of 1,996 genes were differentially expressed in DRG vs. NG, including 41 G protein-coupled receptors and 60 ion channels. Expression profiles obtained on laser-captured neurons were contrasted to those obtained on whole ganglia, demonstrating striking differences and the need for microdissection when studying visceral sensory neurons because of dilution of the signal by somatic sensory neurons. Furthermore, we provide a detailed catalog of all adrenergic and cholinergic, GABA, glutamate, serotonin, and dopamine receptors; voltage-gated potassium, sodium, and calcium channels; and transient receptor potential cation channels present in afferents projecting to the peritoneal cavity.

In this study, we investigated whether the neuronal NOS (nNOS) variant responsible for erection, penile nNOS (PnNOS), can exert a similar effect, and whether the combination of electroporation with a helper-dependent adenovirus (AdV) improves gene transfer. PnNOS and beta-galactosidase cDNAs were cloned in plasmid (pCMV-PnNOS; pCMV-beta-gal) and ""gutless"" AdV (AdV-CMV-PnNOS; AdV-CMV-beta-gal) vectors, and injected into the penis of adult (beta-gal) or aged (PnNOS) rats, with or without electroporation. Penile erection was measured at different times after PnNOS cDNA injection, by electrical field stimulation of the cavernosal nerve. The expression of beta-galactosidase or PnNOS was estimated in penile tissue by either histochemistry and luminometry or Western blot, and the effects of AdV-CMV-PnNOS on mRNA expression were examined by a DNA microarray. We found that electroporation increased pCMV-beta-gal uptake, and its expression was detectable at 56 days. In the aged rats treated with pCMV-PnNOS and electroporation, the maximal intracavernosal:mean arterial pressure ratios were elevated for 11 and 18 days when compared with those in controls. Electroporation intensified penile uptake of as few as 10(6) viral particles (vp) of AdV-CMV-beta-gal, and with 10(7) vp beta-galactosidase was still detectable at 60 days. Electroporated AdV-CMV-PnNOS (10(7) vp) was effective at 18 days in stimulating the erection of aged rats, without inducing the expression of cytotoxic genes. In conclusion, intracavernosal gene therapy with PnNOS cDNA corrected the aging-related erectile dysfunction for at least 18 days when given by electroporation in a helper-dependent AdV at low viral loads.",,; file:12079995,,:Users/hpiwowar/Dropbox/TrackingDataReuse/citation benefit in 11k study/full text and detailed citation history of subsample/12079995.pdf:pdf,,0006-3363,Biology of reproduction,"11k-subset-reviewed,Adenoviridae,Adenoviridae: genetics,Aging,Aging: physiology,Animals,Blotting,Complementary,Complementary: analysis,Complementary: therapeutic use,DNA,Electric Stimulation,Electroporation,Erectile Dysfunction,Erectile Dysfunction: therapy,Gene Expression,Gene Therapy,Gene Therapy: methods,Genetic Vectors,Inbred F344,Male,Nitric Oxide Synthase,Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I,Nitric Oxide Synthase: blood,Nitric Oxide Synthase: genetics,Penile Erection,Penile Erection: physiology,Penis,Penis: enzymology,Penis: metabolism,Plasmids,Rats,Western,beta-Galactosidase,beta-Galactosidase: metabolism,created-microarray-data","11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data",September,3,1033--1041,12079995,,{\^{}\^{}10008\^{}\^{} Gene therapy of erectile dysfunction in the rat with penile neuronal nitric oxide synthase.},http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12222534,67,2002

Using several methods, we identified platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGFA) as the major fibroblast chemoattractant and mitogen from conditioned medium generated by the Calu-6 lung carcinoma cell line. In addition, we showed that Calu-6 tumors express significant levels of PDGFC, and that the levels of expression of these two PDGFRalpha ligands correlate strongly with the degree of stromal fibroblast infiltration into the tumor mass. The most intense expression of PDGFRalpha was observed in fibroblasts in the tumor outer rim.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Mucosal immunization of mice with chimeric, Escherichia coli-expressed VP6, the protein that comprises the intermediate capsid layer of the rotavirus particle, together with attenuated E. coli heat-labile toxin LT(R192G) as an adjuvant, reduces fecal shedding of rotavirus antigen by >95\% after murine rotavirus challenge, and the only lymphocytes required for protection are CD4+ T cells. Because these cells produce cytokines with antiviral properties, the cytokines whose expression is upregulated in intestinal memory CD4+ T cells immediately after rotavirus challenge of VP6/LT(R192G)-immunized mice may be directly or indirectly responsible for the rapid suppression of rotavirus shedding. This study was designed to identify which cytokines are significantly upregulated in intestinal effector sites and secondary lymphoid tissues of intranasally immunized BALB/c mice after challenge with murine rotavirus strain EDIM. Initially, this was done by using microarray analysis to quantify mRNAs for 96 murine common cytokines. With this procedure, the synthesis of mRNAs for gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) was found to be temporarily upregulated in intestinal lymphoid cells of VP6/LT(R192G)-immunized mice at 12 h after rotavirus challenge. These cytokines were also produced in CD4+ T cells obtained from intestinal sites specific to VP6/LT(R192G)-immunized mice after in vitro exposure to VP6 as determined by intracellular cytokine staining and secretion of cytokines. Although genetically modified mice that lack receptors for either IFN-gamma or IL-17 remained protected after immunization, these results provide suggestive evidence that these cytokines may play direct or indirect roles in protection against rotavirus after mucosal immunization of mice with VP6/LT(R192G).",,"; file:17251301 cDNA microarray.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"The identification of new tumor-associated antigens (TAA) is critical for the development of effective immunotherapeutic strategies, particularly in diseases like B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), where few target epitopes are known. To accelerate the identification of novel TAA in B-ALL, we used a combination of expression profiling and reverse immunology. We compared gene expression profiles of primary B-ALL cells with their normal counterparts, B-cell precursors. Genes differentially expressed by B-ALL cells included many previously identified as TAA in other malignancies. Within this set of overexpressed genes, we focused on those that may be functionally important to the cancer cell. The apoptosis-related molecule, BAX, was highly correlated with the ALL class distinction. Therefore, we evaluated BAX and its isoforms as potential TAA. Peptides from the isoform BAX-delta bound with high affinity to HLA-A*0201 and HLA-DR1. CD8+ CTLs specific for BAX-delta epitopes or their heteroclitic peptides could be expanded from normal donors. BAX-delta-specific T cells lysed peptide-pulsed targets and BAX-delta-expressing leukemia cells in a MHC-restricted fashion. Moreover, primary B-ALL cells were recognized by BAX-delta-specific CTL, indicating that this antigen is naturally processed and presented by tumor cells. This study suggests that (a) BAX-delta may serve as a widely expressed TAA in B-ALL and (b) gene expression profiling can be a generalizable tool to identify immunologic targets for cancer immunotherapy.",,"; file:16267031 Gene expression profiling.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"We present an initial characterization of a database that contains temporal expression profiles of sequences found in 35,282 gene predictions within the sea urchin genome. The relative RNA abundance for each sequence was determined at 5 key stages of development using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays that were hybridized with populations of polyA+ RNA sequence. These stages were two-cell, which represents maternal RNA, early blastula, the time at which major tissue territories are specified, early and late gastrula, during which important morphogenetic events occur, and the pluteus larva, which marks the culmination of pre-feeding embryogenesis. We provide evidence that the microarray reliably reports the temporal profiles for the large majority of predicted genes, as shown by comparison to data for many genes with known expression patterns. The sensitivity of this assay allows detection of mRNAs whose concentration is only several hundred copies/embryo. The temporal expression profiles indicate that 5\% of the gene predictions encode mRNAs that are found only in the maternal population while 24\% are embryo-specific. Further, we find that the concentration of >80\% of different mRNAs is modulated by more than a factor of 3 during development.

The present study was undertaken to elucidate TCDD-responsive gene expression profiles and their relationships to the number of DREs in liver cancer cells. Hep3B and HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells were exposed to 50-nM TCDD for 0, 1, 2 and 4h in culture, after which gene expression profiles were analyzed by the microarray hybridization using a chip containing 24,000 cDNAs prepared from the human liver. The TCDD-responsive expression levels in each gene were calculated by dividing the densitometric values of the hybridization signal for h1, h2 and h4 by that of h0, followed by transformation of the resulting data into a log scale with the base of 2. Up- and down-regulated gene expressions were defined as >0.585 and <-0.585 by the log scale (>1.5 and <1/1.5 arithmetically), respectively, exhibited at any time after h0. Hep3B and HepG2 cells had 27 and 58 TCDD-responsive, up-regulated genes, respectively, of which 78\% (21/27) and 62\% (36/58) had one or more DREs. Of these 85, 80 genes were up-regulated exclusively in one of the two lines, with CYP1A1 and PPP1R15A being so regulated in both lines. Expression levels of the up-regulated genes at h1, h2 and h4 were correlated with each other (P<0.01) and the mean of these regressed to the number of DRE(s) in both lines (P<0.01). However, expression of a total of 93 TCDD-responsive, down-regulated genes, of which 46\% contained DRE(s), had no relation to the number of DRE(s).

The expanded version of the rotavirus microarray assay presented herein is capable of identifying (i) five clinically relevant human rotavirus VP4 genotypes (P[4], P[6], P[8], P[9], and P[14]) and (ii) five additional human rotavirus VP7 genotypes (G5, G6, G8, G10, and G12) on one chip. Initially, a total of 80 cell culture-adapted human and animal reference rotavirus strains of known P (P[1] to P[12], P[14], P[16], and P[20]) and G (G1-6, G8 to G12, and G14) genotypes isolated in various parts of the world were employed to evaluate the new microarray assay. All rotavirus strains bearing P[4], P[6], P[8], P[9], or P[14] and/or G1 to G6, G8 to G10, or G12 specificity were identified correctly.

Next, we analyzed a total of 128 rotavirus-positive human stool samples collected in three countries (Brazil, Ghana, and the United States) by this assay and validated its usefulness. The results of this study showed that the assay was sensitive and specific and capable of unambiguously discriminating mixed rotavirus infections from nonspecific cross-reactivity; the inability to discriminate mixed infections from nonspecific cross-reactivity is one of the inherent shortcomings of traditional multiplex reverse transcription-PCR genotyping.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Innate immunity is an ancient and conserved defense mechanism. Although host responses toward various pathogens have been delineated, how these responses are orchestrated in a whole animal is less understood. Through an unbiased genome-wide study performed in Caenorhabditis elegans, we identified a conserved function for endodermal GATA transcription factors in regulating local epithelial innate immune responses. Gene expression and functional RNAi-based analyses identified the tissue-specific GATA transcription factor ELT-2 as a major regulator of an early intestinal protective response to infection with the human bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the adult worm, ELT-2 is required specifically for infection responses and survival on pathogen but makes no significant contribution to gene expression associated with intestinal maintenance or to resistance to cadmium, heat, and oxidative stress. We further demonstrate that this function is conserved, because the human endodermal transcription factor GATA6 has a protective function in lung epithelial cells exposed to P. aeruginosa. These findings expand the repertoire of innate immunity mechanisms and illuminate a yet-unknown function of endodermal GATA proteins.",,; file:16968778 Microarray Analyses.cDNAprobes were prepared from poly (A) RNA and hybridized to spotted microarrays (Supporting Text).

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Many biological processes are intrinsically dynamic, incurring profound changes at both molecular and physiological levels. Systems analyses of such processes incorporating large-scale transcriptome or proteome profiling can be quite revealing. Although consistency between mRNA and proteins is often implicitly assumed in many studies, examples of divergent trends are frequently observed. Here, we present a comparative transcriptome and proteome analysis of growth and stationary phase adaptation in Streptomyces coelicolor, taking the time-dynamics of process into consideration. These processes are of immense interest in microbiology as they pertain to the physiological transformations eliciting biosynthesis of many naturally occurring therapeutic agents. A shotgun proteomics approach based on mass spectrometric analysis of isobaric stable isotope labeled peptides (iTRAQ) enabled identification and rapid quantification of approximately 14\% of the theoretical proteome of S. coelicolor. Independent principal component analyses of this and DNA microarray-derived transcriptome data revealed that the prominent patterns in both protein and mRNA domains are surprisingly well correlated. Despite this overall correlation, by employing a systematic concordance analysis, we estimated that over 30\% of the analyzed genes likely exhibited significantly divergent patterns, of which nearly one-third displayed even opposing trends. Integrating this data with biological information, we discovered that certain groups of functionally related genes exhibit mRNA-protein discordance in a similar fashion. Our observations suggest that differences between mRNA and protein synthesis/degradation mechanisms are prominent in microbes while reaffirming the plausibility of such mechanisms acting in a concerted fashion at a protein complex or sub-pathway level.",,"; file:18461186 Labeled samples were mixed and co-hybridized onto microarrays in the presence of 50\% formamide at 50uC for 16 h.

The expression profiles and roles of these genes in rat liver regeneration (LR) were assayed using bioinformatics and systems biology method. Among the above genes, 1,004 known genes and 857 unknown genes were found to be associated with rat LR. The numbers of the known genes up-regulated, down-regulated, and up/down-regulated were 622, 443, and 15, respectively; that of the unknown genes were 367, 400, and 14, respectively.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Acne vulgaris is a skin disorder of the sebaceous follicles, involving hyperkeratinization and perifollicular inflammation. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) have a predominant role in inflammatory matrix remodeling and hyperproliferative skin disorders. We investigated the expression of MMP and tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMP) in facial sebum specimens from acne patients, before and after treatment with isotretinoin. Gelatin zymography and Western-blot analysis revealed that sebum contains proMMP-9, which was decreased following per os or topical treatment with isotretinoin and in parallel to the clinical improvement of acne. Sebum also contains MMP-1, MMP-13, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2, as assessed by ELISA and western blot, but only MMP-13 was decreased following treatment with isotretinoin. The origin of MMP and TIMP in sebum is attributed to keratinocytes and sebocytes, since we found that HaCaT keratinocytes in culture secrete proMMP-2, proMMP-9, MMP-1, MMP-13, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2. SZ95 sebocytes in culture secreted proMMP-2 and proMMP-9, which was also confirmed by microarray analysis. Isotretinoin inhibited the arachidonic acid-induced secretion and mRNA expression of proMMP-2 and -9 in both cell types and of MMP-13 in HaCaT keratinocytes.

We report the cloning of the CAROTENOID CHLOROPLAST REGULATORY1 (CCR1) gene. The ccr1 mutant has increased shoot branching and altered carotenoid composition, namely, reduced lutein in leaves and accumulation of cis-carotenes in dark-grown seedlings. The CCR1 gene was previously isolated as EARLY FLOWERING IN SHORT DAYS and encodes a histone methyltransferase (SET DOMAIN GROUP 8) that methylates histone H3 on Lys 4 and/or 36 (H3K4 and H3K36). ccr1 plants show reduced trimethyl-H3K4 and increased dimethyl-H3K4 surrounding the CAROTENOID ISOMERASE (CRTISO) translation start site, which correlates with low levels of CRTISO mRNA. Microarrays of ccr1 revealed the downregulation of 85 genes, including CRTISO and genes associated with signaling and development, and upregulation of just 28 genes. The reduction in CRTISO transcript abundance explains the altered carotenoid profile. The changes in shoot branching are additive with more axillary branching mutants, but the altered carotenoid profile may partially affect shoot branching, potentially by perturbed biosynthesis of the carotenoid substrates of strigolactones. These results are consistent with SDG8 regulating shoot meristem activity and carotenoid biosynthesis by modifying the chromatin surrounding key genes, including CRTISO. Thus, the level of lutein, the most abundant carotenoid in higher plants that is critical for photosynthesis and photoprotection, appears to be regulated by a chromatin modifying enzyme in Arabidopsis thaliana.",,"; file:19174535 MicroarraysTranscriptomic analysis was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome ATH1 Arrays (Affymetrix) as described (Rossel et al., 2007).

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Ewing's family tumor (EFT) is a rare pediatric tumor of unclear origin that occurs in bone and soft tissue. Specific chromosomal translocations found in EFT cause EWS to fuse to a subset of ets transcription factor genes (ETS), generating chimeric EWS/ETS proteins. These proteins are believed to play a crucial role in the onset and progression of EFT. However, the mechanisms responsible for the EWS/ETS-mediated onset remain unclear. Here we report the establishment of a tetracycline-controlled EWS/ETS-inducible system in human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs). Ectopic expression of both EWS/FLI1 and EWS/ERG proteins resulted in a dramatic change of morphology, i.e., from a mesenchymal spindle shape to a small round-to-polygonal cell, one of the characteristics of EFT. EWS/ETS also induced immunophenotypic changes in MPCs, including the disappearance of the mesenchyme-positive markers CD10 and CD13 and the up-regulation of the EFT-positive markers CD54, CD99, CD117, and CD271. Furthermore, a prominent shift from the gene expression profile of MPCs to that of EFT was observed in the presence of EWS/ETS. Together with the observation that EWS/ETS enhances the ability of cells to invade Matrigel, these results suggest that EWS/ETS proteins contribute to alterations of cellular features and confer an EFT-like phenotype to human MPCs.",,"; file:18212050 DNA microarray analysis.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Atopic diseases are associated with hyperexpression of Th2 cytokines by allergen-specific T memory cells. However, clinical trials with recently developed Th2 inhibitors in atopics have proven disappointing, suggesting underlying complexities in atopy pathogenesis which are not satisfactorily explained via the classical Th1/Th2 paradigm. One likely possibility is that additional Th2-associated genes which are central to disease pathogenesis remain unidentified. The aim of the present study was to identify such novel Th2-associated genes in recall responses to the inhalant allergen house dust mite. In contrast to earlier human microarray studies in atopy which focused on mitogen-activated T cell lines and clones, we concentrated on PBMC-derived primary T cells stimulated under more physiological conditions of low dose allergen exposure. We screened initially for allergen-induced gene activation by microarray, and validated novel genes in independent panels of subjects by quantitative RT-PCR. Kinetic analysis of allergen responses in PBMC revealed an early wave of novel atopy-associated genes involved in signaling which were coexpressed with IL-4 and IL-4R, followed by a later wave of genes encoding the classical Th2 effector cytokines. We further demonstrate that these novel activation-associated Th2 genes up-regulate in response to another atopy-associated physiological stimulus bacterial superantigen, but remain quiescent in nonphysiological responses in primary T cells or cell lines driven by potent mitogens, which may account for their failure to be detected in earlier microarray studies.",,"; file:16585570 Affymetrix methodologiesTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen Life Technologies) followed by RNeasy (Qiagen).

By controlling gene expression, TNF alpha orchestrates the cutaneous responses to environmental damage and inflammation. To define TNF alpha action in epidermis, we compared the transcriptional profiles of normal human keratinocytes untreated and treated with TNF alpha for 1, 4, 24, and 48 h by using oligonucleotide microarrays. We found that TNF alpha regulates not only immune and inflammatory responses but also tissue remodeling, cell motility, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Specifically, TNF alpha regulates innate immunity and inflammation by inducing a characteristic large set of chemokines, including newly identified TNF alpha targets, that attract neutrophils, macrophages, and skin-specific memory T-cells. This implicates TNF alpha in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, fixed drug eruption, atopic and allergic contact dermatitis. TNF alpha promotes tissue repair by inducing basement membrane components and collagen-degrading proteases. Unexpectedly, TNF alpha induces actin cytoskeleton regulators and integrins, enhancing keratinocyte motility and attachment, effects not previously associated with TNF alpha. Also unanticipated was the influence of TNF alpha upon keratinocyte cell fate by regulating cell-cycle and apoptosis-associated genes. Therefore, TNF alpha initiates not only the initiation of inflammation and responses to injury, but also the subsequent epidermal repair. The results provide new insights into the harmful and beneficial TNF alpha effects and define the mechanisms and genes that achieve these outcomes, both of which are important for TNF alpha-targeted therapies.",,"; file:15145954 Microarray Data Mining—To obtain a comprehensive pic- ture of the transcriptional changes caused by TNF , we grewprimary cultures of untransformed, normal human epidermal keratinocytes and treated them with 50 ng/ml of TNF , which was followed by RNA isolation for microarray experiments.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"The molecular mechanisms by which the anti-HER2 antibodies trastuzumab and its murine equivalent 4D5 inhibit tumor growth and potentiate chemotherapy are not fully understood. Inhibition of signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway may be particularly important. Treatment of breast cancer cells that overexpress HER2 with trastuzumab inhibited HER2-HER3 association, decreased PDK1 activity, reduced Thr-308 and Ser-473 phosphorylation of AKT, and reduced AKT enzymatic activity. To place the role of PI3K-AKT in perspective, gene expression was studied by using Affymetrix microarrays and real time reverse transcription-PCR. Sixteen genes were consistently down-regulated 2.0-4.9-fold in two antibody-treated breast cancer cell lines. Fourteen of the 16 genes were involved in three major functional areas as follows: 7 in cell cycle regulation, particularly of the G(2)-M; 5 in DNA repair/replication; and 2 in modifying chromatin structure. Of the 16 antibody-regulated genes, 64\% had roles in cell growth/maintenance and 52\% contributed to the cell cycle. Direct inhibition of PI3K with an inhibitor markedly reduced expression of 14 genes that were also affected by the antibody. Constitutive activation of AKT1 blocked the effect of the anti-HER2 antibody on cell cycle arrest and on eight differentially expressed genes. The antibody enhanced docetaxel-induced growth inhibition but did not increase the fraction of apoptotic cells induced with docetaxel alone. In contrast, the antibody plus docetaxel markedly down-regulated two genes, HEC and DEEPEST, required for passage through G(2)-M. Thus, anti-HER2 antibody preferentially affects genes contributing to cell cycle progression and cell growth/maintenance, in part through the PI3K-AKT signaling. Transcriptional regulation by anti-HER2 antibody through PI3K-AKT pathway may potentiate the growth inhibitory activity of docetaxel by affecting cell cycle progression.",,"; file:15504738 Affymetrix Oligonucleotide Array Hybridization and Data Acquisi-tion—cRNA hybridization to the human U95A arrays was performed at the M.

The ability for the parasite to convert to the bradyzoite stage and live inside slow-growing cysts that can go unnoticed by the host immune system allows for parasite persistence for the life of the infected host. This intracellular survival likely necessitates host cell modulation, and tachyzoites are known to modify a number of signaling cascades within the host to promote parasite survival. Little is known, however, about how bradyzoites manipulate their host cell. Microarrays were used to profile the host transcriptional changes caused by bradyzoite infection and compared to those of tachyzoite-infected and uninfected hosts cells 2 days postinfection in vitro. Infection resulted in chemokine, cytokine, extracellular matrix, and growth factor transcript level changes. A small group of genes were specifically induced by tachyzoite infection, including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, BCL2-related protein A1, and interleukin-24.

This paper reports the use of oligonucleotide microarray technology to determine changes in gene expression in human keratinocytes after UVB treatment. Examination of the effects of different doses at different times after irradiation gave a global picture of the keratinocyte response to this type of insult. Five hundred thirty-nine regulated transcripts were found and organized into nine different clusters depending on behavior patterns. Classification of these genes into 23 functional categories revealed that several biological processes are globally affected by UVB. In addition to confirming a majority up-regulation of the transcripts related to the UV-specific inflammatory and stress responses, significant increases were seen in the expression of genes involved in basal transcription, splicing, and translation as well as in the proteasome-mediated degradation category. On the other hand, those transcripts belonging to the metabolism and adhesion categories were strongly downregulated. These results demonstrate the complexity of the transcriptional profile of the UVB response, describe several cellular processes previously not known to be affected by UV irradiation, and serve as a basis for the global characterization of UV-regulated genes and pathways.",,"; file:11867738 Array Hybridization and Scanning.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Parthenocarpy is potentially a desirable trait for many commercially grown fruits if undesirable changes to structure, flavour, or nutrition can be avoided. Parthenocarpic transgenic tomato plants (cv MicroTom) were obtained by the regulation of genes for auxin synthesis (iaaM) or responsiveness (rolB) driven by DefH9 or the INNER NO OUTER (INO) promoter from Arabidopsis thaliana. Fruits at a breaker stage were analysed at a transcriptomic and metabolomic level using microarrays, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and a Pegasus III TOF (time of flight) mass spectrometer. Although differences were observed in the shape of fully ripe fruits, no clear correlation could be made between the number of seeds, transgene, and fruit size. Expression of auxin synthesis or responsiveness genes by both of these promoters produced seedless parthenocarpic fruits. Eighty-three percent of the genes measured showed no significant differences in expression due to parthenocarpy. The remaining 17\% with significant variation (P <0.05) (1748 genes) were studied by assigning a predicted function (when known) based on BLAST to the TAIR database. Among them several genes belong to cell wall, hormone metabolism and response (auxin in particular), and metabolism of sugars and lipids. Up-regulation of lipid transfer proteins and differential expression of several indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)- and ethylene-associated genes were observed in transgenic parthenocarpic fruits. Despite differences in several fatty acids, amino acids, and other metabolites, the fundamental metabolic profile remains unchanged. This work showed that parthenocarpy with ovule-specific alteration of auxin synthesis or response driven by the INO promoter could be effectively applied where such changes are commercially desirable.",,"; file:19700496 Tomato microarrays were also purchased from Affymetrix.

In this study, we employed a network modeling approach to dissect and interpret global gene expression patterns in allergen-induced Th cell responses that underpin human atopic disease. We demonstrate that a subnet of interconnected genes enriched for Th2 and regulatory T cell-associated signatures plus many novel genes is hardwired into the atopic response and is a hallmark of atopy at the systems level. We show that activation of this subnet is stabilized via hyperconnected ""hub"" genes, the selective disruption of which can collapse the entire network in a comprehensive fashion. Finally, we investigated gene expression in different Th cell subsets and show that regulatory T cell- and Th2-associated signatures partition at different stages of Th memory cell differentiation. Moreover, we demonstrate the parallel presence of a core element of the Th2-associated gene signature in bystander naive cells, which can be reproduced by rIL-4. These findings indicate that network analysis provides significant additional insight into atopic mechanisms beyond that achievable with conventional microarray analyses, predicting functional interactions between novel genes and previously recognized members of the allergic cascade.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"In Escherichia coli, temperature downshift elicits cold shock response, which is characterized by induction of cold shock proteins. CspA, the major cold shock protein of E. coli, helps cells to acclimatize to low temperature by melting the secondary structures in nucleic acids and acting as a transcription antiterminator. CspA and its homologues contain the cold shock domain and belong to the oligomer binding protein family, which also includes S1 domain proteins such as IF1. Structural similarity between IF1 and CspA homologues suggested a functional overlap between these proteins. Indeed IF1 can melt secondary structures in RNA and acts as transcription antiterminator in vivo and in vitro. Here, we show that in spite of having these critical activities, IF1 does not complement cold-sensitivity of a csp quadruple deletion strain. DNA microarray analysis shows that overproduction of IF1 and Csp leads to changes in expression of different sets of genes. Importantly, several genes which were previously shown to require Csp proteins for their expression at low temperature did not respond to IF1. Moreover, in vitro, we show that a transcription terminator responsive to Csp does not respond to IF1. Our results suggest that Csp proteins and IF1 have different sets of target genes as they may be suppressing the function of different types of transcription termination elements in specific genes.",,; file:19840122,10.1111/j.1365-2443.2009.01346.x,:Users/hpiwowar/Dropbox/TrackingDataReuse/citation benefit in 11k study/full text and detailed citation history of subsample/19840122.pdf:pdf,,1365-2443,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular \& cellular mechanisms,"11k-subset-reviewed,Bacterial,Escherichia coli,Escherichia coli Proteins,Escherichia coli Proteins: genetics,Escherichia coli Proteins: metabolism,Escherichia coli: genetics,Escherichia coli: metabolism,Gene Expression Regulation,Heat-Shock Proteins,Heat-Shock Proteins: genetics,Heat-Shock Proteins: metabolism,Messenger,Messenger: metabolism,Microarray Analysis,Prokaryotic Initiation Factor-1,Prokaryotic Initiation Factor-1: genetics,Prokaryotic Initiation Factor-1: metabolism,RNA,Temperature,Up-Regulation,created-microarray-data","11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data",November,11,1227--1239,19840122,,{\^{}\^{}10177\^{}\^{} Comparative analysis of changes in gene expression due to RNA melting activities of translation initiation factor IF1 and a cold shock protein of the CspA family.},http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19840122,14,2009
11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Most forms of neuronal plasticity are associated with induction of the transcription factor Zif268 (Egr1/Krox24/NGF-IA). In a genome-wide scan, we obtained evidence for potential modulation of proteasome subunit and regulatory genes by Zif268 in neurons, a finding of significance considering emerging evidence that the proteasome modulates synaptic function. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that the candidate proteasome Zif268 target genes had a rich concentration of putative Zif268 binding sites immediately upstream of the transcriptional start sites. Regulation of the mRNAs encoding the psmb9 (Lmp2) and psme2 (PA28beta) proteasome subunits, along with the proteasome-regulatory kinase serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK) and the proteasome-associated antigen peptide transporter subunit 1 (Tap1), was confirmed after transfection of a neuronal cell line with Zif268. Conversely, these mRNAs were upregulated in cerebral cortex tissue from Zif268 knock-out mice relative to controls, confirming that Zif268 suppresses their expression in the CNS. Transfected Zif268 reduced the activity of psmb9, SGK, and Tap1 promoter-reporter constructs. Altered psmb9, SGK, and Tap1 mRNA levels were also observed in an in vivo model of neuronal plasticity involving Zif268 induction: the effect of haloperidol administration on striatal gene expression. Consistent with these effects on proteasome gene expression, increased Zif268 expression suppressed proteasome activity, whereas Zif268 knock-out mice exhibited elevated cortical proteasome activity. Our findings reveal that Zif268 regulates the expression of proteasome and related genes in neuronal cells and provide new evidence that altered expression of proteasome activity after Zif268 induction may be a key component of long-lasting CNS plasticity.",,"; file:16452686 RNA was extracted 48 h after transfection.

To discover molecular targets that are applicable for development of novel breast cancer therapy, we previously did genome-wide expression profile analysis of 81 breast cancers and found dozens of genes that were highly and commonly up-regulated in breast cancer cells. Among them, we here focused on one gene that encodes PDZ-binding kinase/T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (PBK/TOPK), including a kinase domain. Northern blot analyses using mRNAs of normal human organs, breast cancer tissues, and cancer cell lines indicated this molecule to be a novel cancer/testis antigen. Reduction of PBK/TOPK expression by small interfering RNA resulted in significant suppression of cell growth probably due to dysfunction in the cytokinetic process. Immunocytochemical analysis with anti-PBK/TOPK antibody implicated a critical role of PBK/TOPK in an early step of mitosis. PBK/TOPK could phosphorylate histone H3 at Ser10 in vitro and in vivo, and mediated its growth-promoting effect through histone H3 modification. Because PBK/TOPK is the cancer/testis antigen and its kinase function is likely to be related to its oncogenic activity, we suggest PBK/TOPK to be a promising molecular target for breast cancer therapy.",,; file:16982762,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1601,:Users/hpiwowar/Dropbox/TrackingDataReuse/citation benefit in 11k study/full text and detailed citation history of subsample/16982762.pdf:pdf,,0008-5472,Cancer research,"11k-subset-reviewed,Antigens,Breast Neoplasms,Breast Neoplasms: enzymology,Breast Neoplasms: genetics,Breast Neoplasms: immunology,Breast Neoplasms: pathology,Cell Cycle,Cell Cycle: physiology,Cell Line,Female,Histones,Histones: metabolism,Humans,Immunohistochemistry,Neoplasm,Neoplasm: biosynthesis,Neoplasm: genetics,Neoplasm: immunology,Phosphorylation,Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases,Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases: antagonists \& in,Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases: biosynthesis,Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases: genetics,Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases: immunology,Transfection,Tumor,Up-Regulation,created-microarray-data-not","11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data-not",September,18,9186--9195,16982762,,"{\^{}\^{}10027\^{}\^{} PDZ-binding kinase/T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase, a putative cancer/testis antigen with an oncogenic activity in breast cancer.}",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16982762,66,2006

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Recent studies have revealed new roles for NAD and its derivatives in transcriptional regulation. The evolutionarily conserved Sir2 protein family requires NAD for its deacetylase activity and regulates a variety of biological processes, such as stress response, differentiation, metabolism, and aging. Despite its absolute requirement for NAD, the regulation of Sir2 function by NAD biosynthesis pathways is poorly understood in mammals. In this study, we determined the kinetics of the NAD biosynthesis mediated by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) and nicotinamide/nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nmnat), and we examined its effects on the transcriptional regulatory function of the mouse Sir2 ortholog, Sir2alpha, in mouse fibroblasts. We found that Nampt was the rate-limiting component in this mammalian NAD biosynthesis pathway. Increased dosage of Nampt, but not Nmnat, increased the total cellular NAD level and enhanced the transcriptional regulatory activity of the catalytic domain of Sir2alpha recruited onto a reporter gene in mouse fibroblasts. Gene expression profiling with oligonucleotide microarrays also demonstrated a significant correlation between the expression profiles of Nampt- and Sir2alpha-overexpressing cells. These findings suggest that NAD biosynthesis mediated by Nampt regulates the function of Sir2alpha and thereby plays an important role in controlling various biological events in mammals.",,"; file:15381699 Microarray Analysis—RNA samples were purified from Nampt-over- expressing (Nampt1), Sir2-overexpressing (Sir2 ), and neomycin-re- sistant control (Neo1) NIH3T3 cell lines by using an RNeasy kit (Qia- gen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality of RNA was examined by capillary electrophoresis. Eight micrograms of total RNA from each of the NIH3T3 cell lines were converted to cDNA by using the 3DNA Array 350 Expression array detection kit (Genisphere) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Microarray hybridization was then con- ducted with Cy3-and Cy5-labeled dendrimers as described (36) with the following modifications. Hybridization was conducted at 42 °C for 18 h in MWG Coverslips Hybridization Buffer (MWG Biotec), and all post- hybridization washes were carried out at 25 °C. To increase the accu- racy of the microarray analysis, we performed dye-swap experiments for each pair of cell lines (Nampt1 versus Neo1 and Sir2 versus Neo1). Microarray hybridizations were performed in duplicate for each pair with the exception that the Cy3-Cy5 labeling scheme was swapped between hybridizations, i.e. control-Cy3, experimental-Cy5 and exper- imental-Cy5, control-Cy3 (see Fig. 7A). Including dye swaps, four mi- croarray slides were used for each pairwise comparison. A ScanArray Express HT scanner and accompanying software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to scan the slides and analyze the raw data, includ- ing normalization according to the Lowess method (37). Spots used for statistical analysis satisfied the following criteria on at least three of the slides for both sets of comparisons: 1) ScanArray Express FLAG  3; 2) signal to noise ratio2 in both channels. Spot-specific dye bias was corrected by subtracting a correction factor from the log2 of the Lowess- normalized median of ratios in the Cy5 and Cy3 channels. It has been reported that combining dye swapping and filtering out spots with signal intensities near background enables highly reproducible detec- tion of gene expression changes with ratios as low as 1.2-fold (38), which we confirmed in our preliminary microarray experiments. Therefore, genes determined to be changed exhibited at least 1.2-fold differences between experimental and control cell lines with 95\% confidence inter- vals that did not overlap the fold change of 1.",10.1074/jbc.M408388200,:Users/hpiwowar/Dropbox/TrackingDataReuse/citation benefit in 11k study/full text and detailed citation history of subsample/15381699.pdf:pdf,,0021-9258,The Journal of biological chemistry,"11k-subset-reviewed,Animals,Blotting,Catalytic Domain,Cell Differentiation,Chromatography,Complementary,Complementary: metabolism,Cytokines,Cytokines: metabolism,DNA,Dose-Response Relationship,Drug,Fibroblasts,Fibroblasts: metabolism,Fungal Proteins,Fungal Proteins: chemistry,Gene Library,Genes,Genetic,High Pressure Liquid,Kinetics,Luciferases,Luciferases: metabolism,Mice,NAD,NAD: biosynthesis,NAD: chemistry,NIH 3T3 Cells,Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase,Nicotinamide-Nucleotide Adenylyltransferase,Nicotinamide-Nucleotide Adenylyltransferase: metab,Nicotinamide-Nucleotide Adenylyltransferase: physi,Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis,Pentosyltransferases,Pentosyltransferases: metabolism,Phylogeny,Recombinant Proteins,Recombinant Proteins: chemistry,Reporter,Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Saccharomyces cerevisiae: metabolism,Sirtuin 1,Sirtuins,Sirtuins: metabolism,Transcription,Western,created-microarray-data","11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data",December,49,50754--50763,15381699,,{\^{}\^{}10036\^{}\^{} The NAD biosynthesis pathway mediated by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase regulates Sir2 activity in mammalian cells.},http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15381699,279,2004

Therefore, this experiment was conducted to investigate the rate of development and mRNA level of dielectrophoretically separated oocytes and zygotes to validate dielectrophoresis (DEP) as non-invasive option for selection of oocytes and zygotes. In the first experiment, metaphase II oocytes with (PB(+)) and without (PB(-)) first polar body and zygotes were subjected to DEP at 4 MHz and 450 mum electrode distance and classified into fast, very fast, slow, and very slow depending on the time elapsed to reach one of the electrodes in the electric field. Parthenogenetic activation was employed to monitor the embryonic development of dielectrophoretically classified oocytes. The result revealed that at 6 and 7 days of post-activation, the blastocyst rate of very slow dielectrophoretic PB(+) and PB(-) oocytes was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than other groups. Similarly, in zygotes, the blastocyst rate at 7 days post-insemination was higher (P < 0.05) in the very fast dielectrophoretic categories when compared with the slow and very slow categories. In the second experiment, mRNA level was analyzed in the very fast and very slow dielectrophoretic PB(+) oocytes and zygotes respectively using the bovine cDNA microarray. The result showed that 36 and 42 transcripts were differentially regulated between the very fast and very slow dielectrophoretic categories PB(+) oocytes and zygotes respectively.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"The purpose of this study was to perform a comprehensive analysis of hepatic gene expression in a standard model of an alcohol-induced fatty liver using the cDNA microarray analysis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups and were given either an ethanol diet (ED), or a control diet (CD) for eight weeks. The ED rats showed significantly elevated levels of plasma total and HDL cholesterol as well as hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride compared to the pair-fed control rats. Among the 5185 genes on the rat cDNA microarray used in the current study, 74 genes were up-regulated and 108 genes were down-regulated greater than 2.0-fold in the liver of ED rats compared with those in the CD rats. The microarray results were verified by conducting real-time RT-PCR on the fourteen selected genes with varied expression ratios. After clustering the regulated genes based on their biological function, it was found that chronic ethanol consumption regulated mainly the genes implicated in the processes of signal transduction, transcription, immune response, and protein/amino acid metabolism. The microarray results obtained in this study revealed, for the first time, that several genes, including beta-glucuronidase, UDP-glycosyltransferase 1, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, apoC-III, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor, were regulated by chronic ethanol exposure in the rat liver.",,"; file:17920746 Microarray analysis was conducted with the use of the GenePlorerTwinChip Rat-5K (Digital Genomics Co., Seoul, Korea).

Statistical analysis revealed a cluster of genes that were strongly down-regulated by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and which not only function in cell cycle regulation and DNA replication but also mediate checkpoint control, DNA repair, chromosome modifications, and mitosis. Because many of these genes were shown earlier to be regulated by the transcriptional repressor E2F4, the intergenic regions of these 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-down-regulated genes were searched for the presence of E2F binding sites. This led to the characterization of two novel E2F target genes, chromosome condensation-related SMC-associated protein 1 (Cnap1) and maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (Melk). Transfection studies and site-directed mutagenesis confirmed Cnap1 and Melk to be bona fide E2F targets. Repression of Cnap1 and Melk by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) was confirmed not only in MC3T3-E1 cells but also in several other bone-unrelated cell types. This down-regulation as well as the antiproliferative effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) depended on the pocket proteins p107 and p130 because 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) failed to repress these E2F target genes and lost its antiproliferative action in p107(-/-);p130(-/-) cells but not in pRb(-/-) cells.",,"; file:16144839 Scanning and Microarray Data Analysis—Array slides were scannedusing a Generation III scanner (Amersham Biosciences) with wave- length settings at 532 nm (Cy3 signal) and 635 nm (Cy5 signal).

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by the recruitment of leukocytes and the accumulation of inflammatory mediators within the synovial compartment. Release of the chemokine CCL18 has been widely attributed to antigen-presenting cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells. This study investigates the production of CCL18 in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), the predominant cell type recruited into synovial fluid (SF). Microarray analysis, semiquantitative and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction identified SF PMN from patients with RA as a novel source for CCL18 in diseased joints. Highly upregulated expression of other chemokine genes was observed for CCL3, CXCL8 and CXCL10, whereas CCL21 was downregulated. The chemokine receptor genes were differentially expressed, with upregulation of CXCR4, CCRL2 and CCR5 and downregulation of CXCR1 and CXCR2. In cell culture experiments, expression of CCL18 mRNA in blood PMN was induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha, whereas synthesis of CCL18 protein required additional stimulation with a combination of IL-10 and vitamin D3. In comparison, recruited SF PMN from patients with RA were sensitized for CCL18 production, because IL-10 alone was sufficient to induce CCL18 release. These results suggest a release of the T cell-attracting CCL18 by PMN when recruited to diseased joints.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Organophosphate (OP) poisoning can occur through unintentional exposure to OP pesticides, or by the deliberate release of OP nerve agents. Consequently, there is considerable interest in the development of systems that can detect and/or biodegrade these agents. The aim of this study was to generate a prototype fluorescent reporter yeast biosensor that could detect and biodegrade the model OP pesticide, paraoxon, and subsequently detect paraoxon hydrolysis. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was engineered to hydrolyze paraoxon through the heterologous expression of the Flavobacterium species opd (organophosphate degrading) gene. Global transcription profiling was subsequently used to identify yeast genes, which were induced in the presence of paraoxon, and genes, which were associated with paraoxon hydrolysis. Paraoxon-inducible genes and genes associated with paraoxon hydrolysis were identified. Candidate paraoxon-inducible promoters were cloned and fused to the yeast-enhanced green fluorescent protein (yEGFP), and candidate promoters associated with paraoxon hydrolysis were fused to the red fluorescent protein (yDsRed). The ability of the yeast biosensor to detect paraoxon and paraoxon hydrolysis was demonstrated by the specific induction of the fluorescent reporter (yEGFP and yDsRed, respectively). Biosensors responded to paraoxon in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and detection was rapid (15 to 30 min). yDsRed induction occurred only in the recombinant opd(+) strains suggesting that yDsRed induction was strictly associated with paraoxon hydrolysis.

Flies co-injected with a non-lethal dose of Destruxin A and the normally innocuous Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, showed increased mortality and an accompanying increase in bacterial titers.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"The effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and high-level HIV replication on the function of monocytes was investigated. HIV-positive patients had elevated levels of spontaneous production of some or all of the monocyte proinflammatory cytokines measured (interleukin-1beta [IL-1beta], IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha]) compared to uninfected controls. In patients on therapy with high frequencies of monocytes producing proinflammatory cytokines, this frequency was diminished in the context of viremia during an interruption of therapy. Diminished production of proinflammatory cytokines during viremia was restored by culture with autologous CD4(+) T cells or monocytes from an on-therapy time point or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Microarray analysis demonstrated that diminished monocyte production of proinflammatory cytokines was correlated with elevated type I interferon-stimulated gene transcripts. The addition of exogenous alpha 2A interferon diminished the spontaneous production of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha but did not affect responses to LPS, recapitulating the changes observed for HIV-viremic patients. These results suggest that monocyte function is diminished during high-level HIV viremia and that this effect is mediated by chronic stimulation by type I interferons. This effect on monocytes during viremia may play a role in diminished innate or adaptive immune system functions in HIV-infected patients. In addition, the restoration of these functions may also play a role in some immune reconstitution syndromes observed during initiation of therapy.",,"; file:17005663 Microarray analysis.

In this study, it is shown that BABA induces the stress-induced morphogenic response (SIMR). SIMR is observed in plants exposed to sub-lethal stress conditions. Anthocyanin, a known modulator of stress signalling, was also found to accumulate in BABA-treated Arabidopsis. These data and a previous microarray study indicate that BABA induces a stress response in Arabidopsis. High concentrations of amino acids, except for L-glutamine, cause a general amino acid stress inhibition. General amino acid inhibition is prevented by the addition of L-glutamine. L-Glutamine was found to inhibit the BABA-mediated SIMR and anthocyanin accumulation, suggesting that the non-protein amino acid BABA causes a general amino acid stress inhibition in Arabidopsis. L-Glutamine also blocked BABA-induced resistance to heat stress and to the virulent bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. During bacterial infection, priming of the salicylic acid-dependent defence marker PR1 was abolished by L-glutamine treatment.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Hypoxia occurs during a number of conditions in which altered epithelial proliferation is critical, including tumor development. Microarray analysis of colon-derived epithelial cells revealed a hypoxia-dependent increase in the expression of amphiregulin, an EGF receptor (EGFR) ligand that activates epithelial proliferation and has been associated with the development of colonic tumors. Amphiregulin expression was also induced in tissues from mice exposed to whole animal hypoxia. The hypoxic upregulation of amphiregulin was independent of the classic transcriptional response mediated via hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha. Transfection of HeLa cells with truncated amphiregulin promoter reporter constructs revealed that a 37-bp segment upstream from the TATA box retained hypoxic sensitivity. This sequence contains an evolutionarily conserved cAMP response element (CRE) that constitutively binds the CRE binding protein (CREB). Deletion of the CRE abolished sensitivity to hypoxia. Thus hypoxia promotes intestinal epithelial amphiregulin expression in a CRE-dependent manner, an event that may contribute to increased proliferation. These data also further support a role for CREB as an HIF-independent hypoxia-responsive transcription factor in the regulation of intestinal epithelial gene expression.",,"; file:16207795 Gene array analysis.

In the present study, we address molecular and cell biologic features of blasts persisting after 1 week of induction glucocorticoid therapy. Genome-wide gene expression analysis of leukemic samples from precursor B-cell ALL patients (n=18) identified a set of genes differentially expressed in blasts at diagnosis day 0 (d0) and persisting on day 8 (d8). Expression changes indicate a shift towards mature B cells, inhibition of cell cycling and increased expression of adhesion (CD11b/ITGAM) and cytokine (CD119/IFNGR1) receptors. A direct comparison with normal B cells, which are largely therapy resistant, confirmed the differentiation shift at the mRNA (n=10) and protein (n=109) levels. Flow cytometric analysis in independent cohorts of patients confirmed both a decreased proliferative activity (n=13) and the upregulation of CD11b and CD119 (n=29) in d8 blasts. The differentiation shift and low proliferative activity in d8 blasts may account for the persistence of blasts during therapy and affect their sensitivity to further therapeutic treatment.

To investigate the effects of these drugs on gene expression in breast cancer cells, we treated estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cells stably transfected with the aromatase gene (known as MCF-7aro cells) with testosterone, 17 beta-estradiol, two aromatase inhibitors (letrozole and anastrozole), and an antiestrogen (tamoxifen). We found that testosterone or 17 beta-estradiol induced the proliferation of MCF-7aro cells at a rate six times faster than the untreated cells. In addition, the testosterone-induced proliferation of MCF-7aro cells was effectively suppressed by letrozole, anastrozole, or tamoxifen. Microarray analyses on Affymetrix Human Genome U133A GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) were carried out using total RNA isolated from the control and treated cells. At the false discovery rate of 0.05 and a minimum fold-change criteria of 1.5, 104 genes were identified that were up-regulated and 109 genes were identified that were down-regulated by both androgen and estrogen. More than 50\% of these hormone-regulated genes were counter-regulated by all three inhibitors and >90\% were counter-regulated by at least one of the inhibitors. Comparing the effect of each inhibitor on gene expression, we observed that letrozole and anastrozole are more similar in terms of the genes they affect compared with treatment with tamoxifen. To validate the gene expression profiles identified from microarray analyses, the expression patterns of 13 representative genes were examined by Northern analysis. Finally, the genes identified as statistically significant were classified based on their expression patterns and biological function/pathways. The results of this study provide us with a better understanding of the actions of both aromatase inhibitors and antiestrogens at the molecular level.

Specifically, long-term engraftment potential predominantly resides in the quiescent HSC subfraction, and G-CSF mobilization results in the preferential accumulation of quiescent HSC in the periphery. In contrast, stem cells from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients display a constitutive presence in the circulation. To understand the molecular basis for this, we have used microarray technology to analyze the transcriptional differences between dividing and quiescent, normal, and CML-derived CD34+ cells. Our data show a remarkable transcriptional similarity between normal and CML dividing cells, suggesting that the effects of BCR-ABL on the CD34+ cell transcriptome are more limited than previously thought. In addition, we show that quiescent CML cells are more similar to their dividing counterparts than quiescent normal cells are to theirs. We also show these transcriptional differences to be reflected in the altered proliferative activity of normal and CML CD34+ cells. Of the most interest is that the major class of genes that is more abundant in the quiescent cells compared with the dividing cells encodes members of the chemokine family.

Cloning of the corresponding gene, cpst12, confirmed a high level of similarity to Ste12 homologues of other filamentous fungi. Disruption of cpst12 resulted in no alterations in in vitro growth characteristics or colony morphology and an increase in the production of asexual spores, indicating that CpST12 is dispensable for vegetative growth and conidiation on artificial medium. However, the disruption mutants showed a very substantial reduction in virulence on chestnut tissue and a complete loss of female fertility, two symptoms normally conferred by hypovirus infection. Both virulence and female fertility were restored by complementation with the wild-type cpst12 gene. Analysis of transcriptional changes caused by cpst12 gene disruption with a custom C. parastica cDNA microaray chip identified 152 responsive genes. A significant number of these putative CpST12-regulated genes were also responsive to hypovirus infection.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"ABSTRACT : BACKGROUND : The need for an integrated view of data obtained from high-throughput technologies gave rise to network analyses. These are especially useful to rationalize how external perturbations propagate through the expression of genes. To address this issue in the case of drug resistance, we constructed biological association networks of genes differentially expressed in cell lines resistant to methotrexate (MTX). METHODS : Seven cell lines representative of different types of cancer, including colon cancer (HT29 and Caco2), breast cancer (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468), pancreatic cancer (MIA PaCa-2), erythroblastic leukemia (K562) and osteosarcoma (Saos-2), were used. The differential expression pattern between sensitive and MTX-resistant cells was determined by whole human genome microarrays and analyzed with the GeneSpring GX software package. Genes deregulated in common between the different cancer cell lines served to generate biological association networks using the Pathway Architect software. RESULTS : Dikkopf homolog-1 (DKK1) is a highly interconnected node in the network generated with genes in common between the two colon cancer cell lines, and functional validations of this target using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) showed a chemosensitization toward MTX. Members of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A (UGT1A) family formed a network of genes differentially expressed in the two breast cancer cell lines. siRNA treatment against UGT1A also showed an increase in MTX sensitivity. Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (EEF1A1) was overexpressed among the pancreatic cancer, leukemia and osteosarcoma cell lines, and siRNA treatment against EEF1A1 produced a chemosensitization toward MTX. CONCLUSIONS : Biological association networks identified DKK1, UGT1As and EEF1A1 as important gene nodes in MTX-resistance. Treatments using siRNA technology against these three genes showed chemosensitization toward MTX.",,"; file:19732436 MicroarraysGene expression was analyzed by hybridization to the GeneChip® Human Genome U133 PLUS 2.0 from Affymetrix, containing over 54,000 transcripts and variants.

We hypothesized that the tissue-based uteroplacental RAS is dysregulated in preeclampsia. We performed microarray and gene expression studies and confirmed the findings on the protein level by immunohistochemistry in ureteroplacental units from 10 preeclamptic women and 10 women with uneventful pregnancies. All of the women were delivered by cesarean section. We also analyzed plasma renin activity and circulating agonistic angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor autoantibodies. In preeclampsia, we found that the angiotensin II AT1 receptor gene was 5-fold upregulated in decidua (maternal origin). We also found AT1 autoantibodies in preeclamptic women and in their offspring by neonatal cardiomyocyte bioassay compared with women with normal pregnancies and their infants (mother: 17.5+/-2.2 versus 0.05+/-0.4; fetus: 14.5+/-1.8 versus 0.5+/-0.5 Deltabpm). Gene expressions for renin (35.0-fold), angiotensin-converting enzyme (2.9-fold), and angiotensinogen (8.9-fold) were higher in decidua than placenta (fetal origin) in both control and preeclamptic women, whereas the AT1 receptor was expressed 10-fold higher in placenta than in decidua in both groups. Our findings elucidate the ureteroplacental unit RAS in preeclamptic and normal pregnancies. We found that, in preeclampsia, the AT1 receptor expression is particularly high in decidua, combined with pregnancy-specific tissue RAS involving decidual angiotensin II production and AT1 autoantibodies.

Here, we analyzed genome-wide transcription profiling of an in vitro cancerous transformation process. We focused on a cluster of genes whose expression levels increased as a function of p53 and p16(INK4A) tumor suppressors inactivation. This cluster predominantly consists of cell cycle genes and constitutes a signature of a diversity of cancers. By linking expression profiles of the genes in the cluster with the dynamic behavior of p53 and p16(INK4A), we identified a promoter architecture that integrates signals from the two tumor suppressive channels and that maps their activity onto distinct levels of expression of the cell cycle genes, which, in turn, correspond to different cellular proliferation rates. Taking components of the mitotic spindle as an example, we experimentally verified our predictions that p53-mediated transcriptional repression of several of these novel targets is dependent on the activities of p21, NFY, and E2F.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"In most plants, a large fraction of photo-assimilated carbon is stored in the chloroplasts during the day as starch and remobilized during the subsequent night to support metabolism. Mutations blocking either starch synthesis or starch breakdown in Arabidopsis thaliana reduce plant growth. Maltose is the major product of starch breakdown exported from the chloroplast at night. The maltose excess 1 mutant (mex1), which lacks the chloroplast envelope maltose transporter, accumulates high levels of maltose and starch in chloroplasts and develops a distinctive but previously unexplained chlorotic phenotype as leaves mature. The introduction of additional mutations that prevent starch synthesis, or that block maltose production from starch, also prevent chlorosis of mex1. In contrast, introduction of mutations in disproportionating enzyme (DPE1) results in the accumulation of maltotriose in addition to maltose, and greatly increases chlorosis. These data suggest a link between maltose accumulation and chloroplast homeostasis. Microscopic analyses show that the mesophyll cells in chlorotic mex1 leaves have fewer than half the number of chloroplasts than wild-type cells. Transmission electron microscopy reveals autophagy-like chloroplast degradation in both mex1 and the dpe1/mex1 double mutant. Microarray analyses reveal substantial reprogramming of metabolic and cellular processes, suggesting that organellar protein turnover is increased in mex1, though leaf senescence and senescence-related chlorophyll catabolism are not induced. We propose that the accumulation of maltose and malto-oligosaccharides causes chloroplast dysfunction, which may by signaled via a form of retrograde signaling and trigger chloroplast degradation.",,"; file:19946617 Microarray and Quantitative RT–PCR AnalysesFor the microarray analysis, three independent batches of plants were grown in a 12-h photoperiod.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemic and neurodegenerative disorders. Treatment of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein glycosylation, rapidly induced the expression of target genes of the unfolded protein response. However, prolonged treatment also triggered a delayed, caspase-dependent cell death. Microarray analysis of gene expression changes during tunicamycin-induced apoptosis revealed that the Bcl-2 homology domain 3-only family member, Bcl-2 binding component 3/p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (Bbc3/PUMA), was the most strongly induced pro-apoptotic gene. Expression of Bbc3/PUMA correlated with a Bcl-xL-sensitive release of cytochrome c and the activation of caspase-9 and -3. Increased expression of Bbc3/PUMA was also observed in p53-deficient human cells, in response to the ER stressor thapsigargin, and in rat hippocampal neurons after transient forebrain ischemia. Overexpression of Bbc3/PUMA was sufficient to trigger apoptosis in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and human cells deficient in Bbc3/PUMA showed dramatically reduced apoptosis in response to ER stress. Our data suggest that the transcriptional induction of Bbc3/PUMA may be sufficient and necessary for ER stress-induced apoptosis.",,"; file:12913114 Gene expression microarray analysis of tunicamycin-treated SH-SY5Y cellsWe used high density oligonucleotide microarrays to analyze gene expression changes during tunicamycin-induced cell death.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Cap1p, a transcription factor of the basic region leucine zipper family, regulates the oxidative stress response (OSR) in Candida albicans. Alteration of its C-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD) results in Cap1p nuclear retention and transcriptional activation. To better understand the function of Cap1p in C. albicans, we used genome-wide location profiling (chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip) to identify its transcriptional targets in vivo. A triple-hemagglutinin (HA(3)) epitope was introduced at the C terminus of wild-type Cap1p (Cap1p-HA(3)) or hyperactive Cap1p with an altered CRD (Cap1p-CSE-HA(3)). Location profiling using whole-genome oligonucleotide tiling microarrays identified 89 targets bound by Cap1p-HA(3) or Cap1p-CSE-HA(3) (the binding ratio was at least twofold; P < or = 0.01). Strikingly, Cap1p binding was detected not only at the promoter region of its target genes but also at their 3' ends and within their open reading frames, suggesting that Cap1p may associate with the transcriptional or chromatin remodeling machinery to exert its activity. Overrepresented functional groups of the Cap1p targets (P < or = 0.02) included 11 genes involved in the OSR (CAP1, GLR1, TRX1, SOD1, CAT1, and others), 13 genes involved in response to drugs (PDR16, MDR1, FLU1, YCF1, FCR1, and others), 4 genes involved in phospholipid transport (PDR16, GIT1, RTA2, and orf19.932), and 3 genes involved in the regulation of nitrogen utilization (GST3, orf19.2693, and orf19.3121), suggesting that Cap1p has other cellular functions in addition to the OSR. Bioinformatic analyses of the bound sequences suggest that Cap1p recognizes the DNA motif 5'-MTKASTMA.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Pulmonary metastases frequently develop in patients with aggressive bladder cancer, yet investigation of this process at the molecular level suffers from the poor availability of human metastatic tumor tissue and the absence of suitable animal models. To address this, we developed progressively more metastatic human bladder cancer cell lines and an in vivo bladder-cancer lung-metastasis model, and we successfully used these to identify genes of which the expression levels change according to the degree of pulmonary metastatic potential. By initially intravenously injecting the poorly metastatic T24T human urothelial cancer cells into nude mice, and then serially reintroducing and reisolating the human tumor cells from the resultant mouse lung tumors, three derivative human lines with increasingly metastatic phenotypes, designated FL1, FL2, and FL3, were sequentially isolated. To identify the genes associated with the most lung-metastatic phenotype, the RNA complement from the parental and derivative cells was evaluated with oligonucleotide microarrays. In doing so, we found 121 genes to be progressively up-regulated during the transition from T24T to FL3, whereas 43 genes were progressively down-regulated. As expected, many of the genes identified in these groups could, according to the ascribed functions of their protein product, theoretically participate in tissue invasion and metastasis. In addition, the magnitude of gene expression changes observed during the metastatic transition correlated with the in vivo propensity for earlier lung colonization and decreased host survival. To additionally define which genes found in the experimental system were of relevance to human bladder cancer lung metastasis, we evaluated gene expression profiles of 23 primary human bladder tumors of various stages and grades, and then we compared these gene expression profiles to the altered profiles in our model cell lines. Here we found that the expression of epiregulin, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)14, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-2) were consistently and progressively up-regulated when viewed as a function of tumor stage in tissues of patients versus the metastatic potential seen in the mouse lung model. The strong correlation of these four markers between the experimental and clinical situations helps validate this system as a useful tool for the study of lung metastasis and defines targets of therapy that may reduce the incidence of this process in patients.",,"; file:15520187 Gene Expression Profiling of Bladder Cell Lines in the Lung MetastasisModel and Human Primary Bladder Tumors.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"The cathepsins are a family of cysteine proteases that have been broadly implicated in proteolytic processes during cell growth, cell development, and normal adult cellular function. Cathepsin L is a major secretory product of rat and mouse Sertoli cells, the absence of which in furless mice is associated with atrophy of some seminiferous tubules. However, furless mice produce viable sperm, suggesting the possibility that other members of the cathepsin family of proteases may complement cathepsin L action in the testis. Our objective herein was to begin to test this hypothesis. To this end, we first utilized cDNA microarray technology to identify the members of the cathepsin gene family expressed by freshly isolated adult rat Sertoli cells. This approach, complemented by Northern blot analyses, showed that in addition to cathepsin L, cathepsin K is highly and specifically expressed in Sertoli cells. As is also true of cathepsin L, cathepsin K mRNA was found to be expressed by Sertoli cells at specific stages of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium, with maximal expression at stages VI-VII. The use of immunocytochemical methods revealed that cathepsin K protein localizes to the cytoplasm of Sertoli cells at stages VI-VIII, to small punctuate lysosomes at stages I-VIII and XIII-XIV, and to early and late residual bodies at stages IX-XII. This localization was found to be similar to that of cathepsin L. The similarity in the expression and localization of cathepsin K and cathepsin L suggest that the two proteases may have similar functions. If true, this might explain the fertility of furless mice. Further, the results suggest that cathepsin K, in both its secreted and lysosomal forms, may play a role in the degradation of Sertoli cell residual bodies.",,"; file:14585819 using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufac- turer’s instructions.

To delineate comprehensively the involvement of CD40 (TNFRSF5) in EC activation, we combined RNAi-mediated CD40 knockdown with comparative genome-wide transcriptional profiling of ECs interacting with (CD154+) T cells. We report the initiation of a profound stress response in ECs upon CD40-CD154 engagement through early up-regulation of, among others, the major proinflammatory NF-kappaB and MAPK/SAPK pathways and their associated transcription factors. Moreover, we have identified novel genes regulated through the CD40-CD154 interaction, and pathways previously unrecognized to be induced by CD40 signaling in ECs. Thus, we document a significant down-regulation of endothelial APLN by CD40-CD154 interaction, TNFalpha/IFNgamma exposure, and in immune-inflammatory pathologies, which could lead to hemodynamic dysfunction. Conversely, CD40-mediated up-regulation of the viral immune surveillance system, notably TLR3, IFIH1, RIG-I, and RNASEL, establishes a reverse link from adaptive to innate immunity in ECs. Moreover, systematic enrichment analysis substantiates endothelial CD40 involvement in the transcriptional regulation of gene networks associated with adhesion and motility, immunity, cell fate control, hemostasis, and metabolism.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data-not,"Laser capture microdissection (LCM) is increasingly being used in quantitative gene expression studies of the nervous system. The current study aimed at determining the impact of various tissue manipulations on the integrity of extracted RNA in LCM studies. Our data indicate that various tissue preparation strategies prior to microdissection may decrease RNA quality by as much as 25\%, thus affecting expression profiles of some genes. To circumvent this problem, we developed a strategy for reverse transcriptase real-time PCR that has considerable sensitivity and can be used to calculate relative changes in gene expression. This approach was validated in subregions of the rat cerebellum. Accordingly, expression of glial gene markers - myelin-associated glycoprotein and proteolipid protein 1 - was found 70-160-fold higher in the white matter layer of the cerebellar cortex as compared to the neuron-enriched granular layer.

Furthermore, this approach had high sensitivity and specificity as we were able to detect a 38\% decrease in the expression of neuron-specific enolase without a change in the expression of glial markers following administration of the neurotoxin, ibotenic acid.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Ureteric bud (UB) emergence from the Wolffian duct (WD), the initiating step in metanephric kidney morphogenesis, is dependent on GDNF; however, GDNF by itself is generally insufficient to induce robust budding of the isolated WD in culture. Thus, additional factors, presumably peptides or polypeptide growth factors, might be involved. Microarray data from in vivo budding and non-budding conditions were analyzed using non-negative matrix factorization followed by gene ontology filtering and network analysis to identify sets of genes that are highly regulated during budding. These included the GDNF co-receptors GFRalpha1 and RET, as well as neuropeptide Y (NPY). By using ANOVA with pattern matching, NPY was also found to correlate most significantly to the budded condition with a high degree of connectedness to genes with developmental roles. Exogenous NPY [as well as its homolog, peptide YY (PYY)] augmented GDNF-dependent budding in the isolated WD culture; conversely, inhibition of NPY signaling or perturbation of NPY expression inhibited budding, confirming that NPY facilitates this process. NPY was also found to reverse the decreased budding, the downregulation of RET expression, the mislocalization of GFRalpha1, and the inhibition of AKT phosphorylation that resulted from the addition of BMP4 to the isolated WD cultures, suggesting that NPY acts through the budding pathway and is reciprocally regulated by GDNF and BMP4. Thus, the outgrowth of the UB from the WD might result from a combination of the upregulation of the GDNF receptors together with genes that support GDNF signaling in a feed-forward loop and/or counteraction of the inhibitory pathway regulated by BMP4.",,"; file:19934016 Microarray analysis RNA from the various tissues was isolated with the Abion RNAqueous Micro Kit (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

YJL217W is also known as REE1 (Regulation of Enolase I). Both the Gal4 regulatory region and the Mac1 binding domain were found on the upstream region of REE1, and the expression of REE1 was up-regulated by galactose but not by glucose. The up-regulation of REE1 by galactose was not observed in the Deltagal4 strain. From the two-hybrid analysis, we found that Ree1 physically interacted with Gal83. Furthermore, from 2-D gel electrophoresis we found that the deletion of REE1 resulted in the up-regulation of Eno1. From Western blotting, we learned that the expression of Eno1 in the Deltaree1 strain was different from that in wild-type strains and that Eno1 expression was not changed by glucose stimulation. Taken together, these results suggest that Ree1p functions in the galactose metabolic pathway via the Gal83 protein and that it may control the level of Eno1p, which is also affected by the Snf1 complex, in S. cerevisiae.",,"; file:18851946 cDNA micro array exper i ment.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data-not,"Microarray analysis was performed to find a new group of genes or pathways that might be important in adipocyte development and metabolism. Among them, a mouse interferon-stimulated gene 12b1 (ISG12b1) is expressed at a 400-fold higher level in adipocytes compared with stromal-vascular cells. It is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue among other tissues we tested. Developmentally, ISG12b1 mRNA expression was initially inhibited followed by a dramatic induction during both in vivo and in vitro adipogenic differentiation. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of ISG12b1 inhibited adipogenic differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells as shown by decreased lipid staining with Oil-Red-O and reduction in adipogenic marker proteins including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBPalpha). Our bioinformatics analysis for the predicted localization of ISG12b1 protein suggested the mitochondrial localization, which was confirmed by the colocalization of hemagglutinin-tagged ISG12b1 protein with mitochondrial marker MitoTracker. In addition, ISG12b1 protein was exclusively detected in protein extract from the fractionated mitochondria by Western blot analysis. Furthermore, overexpression of ISG12b1 in adipocytes reduced mitochondrial DNA content and gene expression of mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), and cytochrome oxidase II, suggesting an inhibitory role of ISG12b1 in mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Activation of mitochondrial biogenesis and function by treatment with PPARgamma and PPARalpha agonists in 3T3-L1 cells and cold exposure in mice induced mitochondrial transcription factors and reduced ISG12 expression. These data demonstrated that mitochondrial-localized ISG12b1 protein inhibits adipocyte differentiation and mitochondrial biogenesis and function, implying the important role of mitochondrial function in adipocyte development and associated diseases.",,; file:18948406,10.1210/en.2008-0727,:Users/hpiwowar/Dropbox/TrackingDataReuse/citation benefit in 11k study/full text and detailed citation history of subsample/18948406.pdf:pdf,,1945-7170,Endocrinology,"11k-subset-reviewed,3T3-L1 Cells,3T3-L1 Cells: metabolism,3T3-L1 Cells: physiology,Adenoviridae,Adenoviridae: genetics,Adipogenesis,Adipogenesis: genetics,Adipose Tissue,Adipose Tissue: metabolism,Amino Acid Sequence,Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Differentiation: genetics,Down-Regulation,Down-Regulation: genetics,Forskolin,Forskolin: pharmacology,Gene Expression Regulation,Gene Expression Regulation: drug effects,Genetic,Interferons,Interferons: pharmacology,Membrane Proteins,Membrane Proteins: genetics,Membrane Proteins: metabolism,Membrane Proteins: physiology,Mice,Mitochondria,Mitochondria: metabolism,Molecular Sequence Data,Obese,Proteins,Proteins: genetics,Proteins: metabolism,Proteins: physiology,Transduction,created-microarray-data-not","11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data-not",March,3,1217--1224,18948406,,{\^{}\^{}10063\^{}\^{} Interferon-stimulated gene ISG12b1 inhibits adipogenic differentiation and mitochondrial biogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells.},http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18948406,150,2009
11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"We have experimentally and computationally defined a set of genes that form a conserved metabolic module in the alpha-proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus and used this module to illustrate a schema for the propagation of pathway-level annotation across bacterial genera. Applying comprehensive forward and reverse genetic methods and genome-wide transcriptional analysis, we (1) confirmed the presence of genes involved in catabolism of the abundant environmental sugar myo-inositol, (2) defined an operon encoding an ABC-family myo-inositol transmembrane transporter, and (3) identified a novel myo-inositol regulator protein and cis-acting regulatory motif that control expression of genes in this metabolic module. Despite being encoded from non-contiguous loci on the C. crescentus chromosome, these myo-inositol catabolic enzymes and transporter proteins form a tightly linked functional group in a computationally inferred network of protein associations. Primary sequence comparison was not sufficient to confidently extend annotation of all components of this novel metabolic module to related bacterial genera. Consequently, we implemented the Graemlin multiple-network alignment algorithm to generate cross-species predictions of genes involved in myo-inositol transport and catabolism in other alpha-proteobacteria. Although the chromosomal organization of genes in this functional module varied between species, the upstream regions of genes in this aligned network were enriched for the same palindromic cis-regulatory motif identified experimentally in C. crescentus. Transposon disruption of the operon encoding the computationally predicted ABC myo-inositol transporter of Sinorhizobium meliloti abolished growth on myo-inositol as the sole carbon source, confirming our cross-genera functional prediction. Thus, we have defined regulatory, transport, and catabolic genes and a cis-acting regulatory sequence that form a conserved module required for myo-inositol metabolism in select alpha-proteobacteria.

Furthermore, this knowledge could allow us to develop gene-targeted inhibitors to prevent viral reactivation. Mice latent with HSV-1 strain McKrae and uninfected control mice were subjected to hyperthermic stress (43 degrees C for 10 min) and their trigeminal ganglia (TG) collected 1 h later. Two additional groups included HSV-1 latently infected and uninfected mice not subjected to hyperthermic stress. Poly A+ mRNA was enriched from total mouse TG RNA and reverse transcribed using MMLV RT. Radioactively labeled cDNAs were analyzed by microarray analysis. A stress/toxicology array of 149 mouse genes on a nylon membrane was used. The labeled cDNAs prepared from latently infected, stressed mice demonstrated 3-fold or greater increases in certain mRNA-early response genes (ERGs) compared to cDNAs from uninfected, stressed control mice. The ERG mRNAs that showed increases included two heat shock proteins (HSP60 and HSP40), a basic transcription factor (BTF T62), a DNA repair enzyme, two kinases [MAP kinase and a stress-induced protein kinase (SADK)], an oxidative stress-induced protein, a manganese superoxide dismutase precursor-2 (SOD-2), and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). The gene expression in unstressed, infected TGs was similar to the gene expression in unstressed, uninfected controls.

Ripening initiation in grape berries is non-climacteric and not well understood at the molecular level. Evidence is lacking for a single master switch controlling this process, such as the established role for ethylene in climacteric fruit ripening. We used Affymetrix microarray analyses of 32 individual Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon berries sampled from two clusters at 50\% ripening initiation. By delineating four developmental stages of ripening initiation, we demonstrate that pigmentation is a statistically significant indicator of transcriptional state during ripening initiation. We report on clustered gene expression patterns which were mined for genes annotated with signal transduction functions in order to advance regulatory network modeling of ripening initiation in grape berries. Abscisic acid has previously been demonstrated to be an important signaling component regulating ripening initiation in grapevine.

To test this hypothesis, apoE-deficient mice were fed a Western-type diet enriched with linoleic acid isomers, and their hepatic gene expression was analyzed with DNA microarrays. To provide an initial screening of candidate genes, only 12 with remarkably modified expression between both CLA isomers were considered and confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. Additionally mRNA expression of 15 genes involved in lipid metabolism was also studied. Ten genes (Fsp27, Aqp4, Cd36, Ly6d, Scd1, Hsd3b5, Syt1, Cyp7b1, and Tff3) showed significant associations among their expressions and the degree of hepatic steatosis. Their involvement was also analyzed in other models of steatosis. In hyperhomocysteinemic mice lacking Cbs gene, only Fsp27, Cd36, Scd1, Syt1, and Hsd3b5 hepatic expressions were associated with steatosis. In apoE-deficient mice consuming olive-enriched diet displaying reduction of the fatty liver, only Fsp27 and Syt1 expressions were found associated. Using this strategy, we have shown that expression of these genes is highly associated with hepatic steatosis in a genetic disease such as Cbs deficiency and in two common situations such as Western diets containing CLA isomers or a Mediterranean-type diet.

This study focuses on miRNAs that are expressed in the mouse cochlea and vestibule, the 2 inner ear compartments. A conditional knock-out mouse for Dicer1 demonstrated that miRNAs are crucial for postnatal survival of functional hair cells of the inner ear. We identified miRNAs that have a role in the vertebrate developing inner ear by combining miRNA transcriptome analysis, spatial and temporal expression patterns, and bioinformatics. Microarrays revealed similar miRNA profiles in newborn-mouse whole cochleae and vestibules, but different temporal and spatial expression patterns of six miRNAs (miR-15a, miR-18a, miR-30b, miR-99a, miR-182, and miR-199a) may reflect their roles. Two of these miRNAs, miR-15a-1 and miR-18a, were also shown to be crucial for zebrafish inner ear development and morphogenesis. To suggest putative target mRNAs whose translation may be inhibited by selected miRNAs, we combined bioinformatics-based predictions and mRNA expression data. Finally, we present indirect evidence that Slc12a2, Cldn12, and Bdnf mRNAs may be targets for miR-15a.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop mechanism-based approaches for the management of ovarian cancer. To this end, the effect of several NSAIDs on ovarian cancer cells was investigated as assessed by the induction of NAG-1/MIC-1/GDF-15, a proapoptotic gene belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily. Sulindac sulfide was the most significant NSAID activated gene 1 (NAG-1) inducer and its expression was inversely associated with cell viability as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay. This growth suppression by sulindac sulfide was recovered by transfection of NAG-1 small interfering RNA. These results indicate that NAG-1 is one of the genes responsible for growth suppression by sulindac sulfide. Furthermore, we observed down-regulation of p21 WAF1/CIP1 by introduction of NAG-1 small interfering RNA into sulindac sulfide-treated cells. In addition, to elucidate other potential molecular mechanisms involved in sulindac sulfide treatment of ovarian cancer cells, we did a membrane-based microarray experiment.

In order to better understand the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which EMP exerts its effects on hormone-resistant PC3 prostate cancer cells, we have utilized microarray to interrogate 22,215 known genes to determine the gene expression profiles altered by EMP treatment. The purpose of this investigation was to identify gene expression profile first and then in future studies determine the specific role of these genes in EMP-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. We found a total of 726 genes which showed >2 fold change after EMP treatment. Clustering analysis showed 12 different types of expression alteration. These genes were also subjected to cluster analysis according to their biological functions. We found that EMP regulated the expression of genes, which are critically involved in the regulation of cell growth, cell cycle, apoptosis, iron homeostasis, cytoskeleton and cell signaling transduction. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was used to confirm the results of microarray, and the results of real-time quantitative RT-PCR were consistent with the microarray data.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"In an effort to identify genes whose expression is regulated by activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, we performed microarray analysis and subsequent quantitative reverse transcription-PCR on an isogenic set of PTEN gene-targeted human cancer cells. Numerous p53 effectors were upregulated following PTEN deletion, including p21, GDF15, PIG3, NOXA, and PLK2. Stable depletion of p53 led to reversion of the gene expression program. Western blots revealed that p53 was stabilized in HCT116 PTEN(-/-) cells via an Akt1-dependent and p14(ARF)-independent mechanism. Stable depletion of PTEN in untransformed human fibroblasts and epithelial cells also led to upregulation of p53 and senescence-like growth arrest. Simultaneous depletion of p53 rescued this phenotype, enabling PTEN-depleted cells to continue proliferating. Next, we tested whether oncogenic PIK3CA, like inactivated PTEN, could activate p53. Retroviral expression of oncogenic human PIK3CA in MCF10A cells led to activation of p53 and upregulation of p53-regulated genes. Stable depletion of p53 reversed these PIK3CA-induced expression changes and synergized with oncogenic PIK3CA in inducing anchorage-independent growth. Finally, targeted deletion of an endogenous allele of oncogenic, but not wild-type, PIK3CA in a human cancer cell line led to a reduction in p53 levels and a decrease in the expression of p53-regulated genes. These studies demonstrate that activation of PI3K signaling by mutations in PTEN or PIK3CA can lead to activation of p53-mediated growth suppression in human cells, indicating that p53 can function as a brake on phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate-induced mitogenesis during human cancer pathogenesis.",,"; file:17060456 Microarray analysis.

We have used cDNA microarray analysis to assess gene expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) that were stimulated with human C5a in vitro. Chip analyses were confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and by Western blot analysis. Gene activation responses were remarkably similar to gene expression patterns of HUVECs stimulated with human tumor necrosis factor-alpha or bacterial lipopolysaccharide. HUVECs stimulated with C5a showed progressive increases in gene expression for cell adhesion molecules (eg, E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1), cytokines/chemokines, and related receptors (eg, VEGFC, IL-6, IL-18R). Surprisingly, HUVECs showed little evidence for up-regulation of complement-related genes. There were transient increases in gene expression associated with broad functional activities. The three agonists used also caused down-regulation of genes that regulate angiogenesis and drug metabolism. With a single exception, C5a caused little evidence of activation of complement-related genes.

Genome sequencing of Chlamydia trachomatis revealed an ORF, CT630 (chxR), whose amino acid sequence contains a winged helix-turn-helix motif similar to the DNA-binding domain of response regulators in the OmpR subfamily. ChxR differs from many response regulators in that essential residues in the receiver or phosphorylation domain are lacking. ChxR functions as a transcriptional regulator because it activated transcription of ompF and ompC when expressed in Escherichia coli. In vitro transcription combined with microarray analysis also demonstrated that ChxR activates its own expression by binding directly to sites upstream of chxR; it also activates infA, tufA, oppA, and CT084. DNase I protection studies showed that ChxR bound to sites in the ompF and ompC promoter proximal regions that overlap but were distinct from OmpR binding sites.

While a number of protein-encoding genes are known to be involved in this process, information on the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in TGF-beta-induced cell migration and invasion is still limited.

The knockdown of miR-155 suppressed TGF-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tight junction dissolution, as well as cell migration and invasion. Further, the ectopic expression of miR-155 reduced RhoA protein and disrupted tight junction formation. Reintroducing RhoA cDNA without the 3' untranslated region largely reversed the phenotype induced by miR-155 and TGF-beta. In addition, elevated levels of miR-155 were frequently detected in invasive breast cancer tissues.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) RNA was obtained from four male Marine recruits (ages 17-19 yr) who presented with symptoms consistent with EHI, core temperatures ranging from 39.3 to 42.5 degrees C, and elevations in serum enzymes such as creatine kinase. Controls were age- and gender-matched Marines from whom samples were obtained before and several days after an intense field-training exercise in the heat (""The Crucible""). Expression analysis was performed on Affymetrix arrays (containing approximately 12,600 sequences) from pooled samples obtained at three times for EHI group (at presentation, 2-3 h after cooling, and 1-2 days later) and compared with control values (average signals from two chips representing pre- and post-Crucible samples). After post hoc filtering, the analysis identified 361 transcripts that had twofold or greater increases in expression at one or more of the time points assayed and 331 transcripts that had twofold or greater decreases in expression. The affected transcripts included sequences previously shown to be heat-shock responsive in PBMCs in vitro (including both heat shock proteins and non-heat shock proteins), a number of sequences whose changes in expression had not previously been noted as a result of in vitro heat shock in PBMCs (including several interferon-induced sequences), and several nonspecific stress response genes (including ubiquitin C and dual-specificity phosphatase-1). We conclude that EHI produces a broad stress response that is detectable in PBMCs and that heat stress per se can only account for some of the observed changes in transcript expression.

Codonusage in Buchnera has been overcome by the high mutational bias towards AT bases. However, several lines of evidence for codon usage selection are given here. A significant correlation was found between tRNA relative abundances and codon composition of Buchnera genes. A significant codon usage bias was found for the choice of rare codons in Buchnera: C-ending codons are preferred in highly expressed genes, whereas G-ending codons are avoided. This bias is not explained by GC skew in the bacteria and might correspond to a selection for perfect matching between codon-anticodon pairs for some essential amino acids in Buchnera proteins.

We compared the gene-expression profiles between transformed DLBCL and their antecedent FL. No genes were observed to increase or decrease their expression in all of the cases of histological transformation. However, two different gene-expression profiles associated with the transformation process were defined, one in which c-myc and genes regulated by c-myc showed increased expression and one in which these same genes showed decreased expression. Further, there was a striking difference in gene-expression profiles between transformed DLBCL and de novo DLBCL, because the gene-expression profile of transformed DLBCL was more similar to their antecedent FL than to de novo DLBCL. This study demonstrates that transformation from FL to DLBCL can occur by alternative pathways and that transformed DLBCL and de novo DLBCL have very different gene-expression profiles that may underlie the different clinical behaviors of these two types of morphologically similar lymphomas.",,"; file:12077300 cDNA Microarray Procedures.

After subtraction of the artificial, random or cross-hybridization signals, data about 5315 genes have been effectively analysed in all samples. The assay revealed >/=4-fold difference in the average expression of 263 genes in all CML samples when compared to normal counterparts, with 148 genes being upregulated and 115 being downregulated. Differentially expressed genes include those associated with BCR/ABL-induced abnormalities in signal transduction, gene transactivation, cell cycle, apoptosis, adhesion, DNA repair, differentiation, metabolism and malignant progression. Interestingly, CML-blast crisis cells in peripheral blood differ from those from bone marrow, indicating major changes in gene expression profiles upon entering into the bloodstream. Moreover, BCR/ABL modulates expression of genes, which are involved in regulation of chromosome/chromatin/DNA dynamics during S and M cell cycle phase.

This social dominance and subordination model has been postulated to simulate early changes in the onset of depression in the losers. Microarrays were fabricated containing 45mer oligonucleotides spotted in quadruplicate and representing 1178 brain-associated genes. Dynamic range, discrimination power, accuracy and reproducibility were determined with standard mRNA ""spiking"" studies. Gene expression profiles in dominant and subordinate animals were compared using a ""universal"" reference design [Churchill GA (2002) Fundamentals of experimental design for cDNA microarrays. Nat Genet 32 (Suppl):490-495]. Data were analyzed by significance analysis of microarrays using rank scores [Tusher VG, Tibshirani R, Chu G (2001) Significance analysis of microarrays applied to the ionizing radiation response. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98:5116-5121; van de Wiel MA (2004) Significance analysis of microarrays using rank scores. Kwantitatieve Methoden 71:25-37].

Twenty-two transcripts were statistically significantly differentially expressed in the neocortex between dominant and subordinate animals. Ontological analyses revealed that significant gene changes were clustered primarily into functional neurochemical pathways associated with protein biosynthesis and cytoskeletal dynamics. The most robust of these were the increased expression of interleukin-18, heat shock protein 27, beta3-tubulin, ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 in subordinate animals. Interleukin-18 has been found to be over-expressed in human depression and panic disorder as well as other physiological stress paradigms [Takeuchi M, Okura T, Mori T, Akita K, Ohta T, Ikeda M, Ikegami H, Kurimoto M (1999) Intracellular production of interleukin-18 in human epithelial-like cell lines is enhanced by hyperosmotic stress in vitro.

Kinetoplastid parasites could be considered as model organisms for studying factors involved in posttranscriptional regulation because they control gene expression almost exclusively at this level. The PUF (Pumilio/FBF1) protein family regulates mRNA stability and translation in eukaryotes, and several members have been identified in trypanosomatids. We used a ribonomic approach to identify the putative target mRNAs associated with TcPUF6, a member of the T. cruzi PUF family. TcPUF6 is expressed in discrete sites in the cytoplasm at various stages of the parasite life cycle and is not associated with the translation machinery. The overexpression of a tandem affinity purification-tagged TcPUF6 protein allowed the identification of associated mRNAs by affinity purification assays and microarray hybridization yielding nine putative target mRNAs. Whole expression analysis of transfected parasites showed that the mRNAs associated with TcPUF6 were down-regulated in populations overexpressing TcPUF6. The association of TcPUF6 with the TcDhh1 helicase in vivo and the cellular co-localization of these proteins in epimastigote forms suggest that TcPUF6 promotes degradation of its associated mRNAs through interaction with RNA degradation complexes. Analysis of the mRNA levels of the putative TcPUF6-regulated genes during the parasite life cycle showed that their transcripts were up-regulated in metacyclic trypomastigotes. In these infective forms no co-localization between TcPUF6 and TcDhh1 was observed.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"The RpoN-RpoS alternative sigma factor pathway is essential for key adaptive responses by Borrelia burgdorferi, particularly those involved in the infection of a mammalian host. A putative response regulator, Rrp2, is ostensibly required for activation of the RpoN-dependent transcription of rpoS. However, questions remain regarding the extent to which the three major constituents of this pathway (Rrp2, RpoN and RpoS) act interdependently. To assess the functional interplay between Rrp2, RpoN and RpoS, we employed microarray analyses to compare gene expression levels in rrp2, rpoN and rpoS mutants of parental strain 297. We identified 98 genes that were similarly regulated by Rrp2, RpoN and RpoS, and an additional 47 genes were determined to be likely regulated by this pathway. The substantial overlap between genes regulated by RpoS and RpoN provides compelling evidence that these two alternative sigma factors form a congruous pathway and that RpoN regulates B. burgdorferi gene expression through RpoS. Although several known B. burgdorferi virulence determinants were regulated by the RpoN-RpoS pathway, a defined function has yet to be ascribed to most of the genes substantially regulated by Rrp2, RpoN and RpoS.",,"; file:18757798 The resulting cDNA was labelled with Cy3 or Cy5.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is accompanied by reduced bone mineral density, which appears to be exacerbated by certain HIV protease inhibitors (PIs). The mechanisms leading to this apparent paradox, however, remain unclear. We have previously shown that, the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 used at levels similar those in plasmas of untreated HIV(+) patients, induced expression of the osteoclast (OC) differentiation factor RANKL in CD4+ T cells. In addition, the HIV PI ritonavir abrogated the interferon-gamma-mediated degradation of the RANKL nuclear adapter protein TRAF6, a physiological block to RANKL activity. Here, using oligonucleotide microarrays and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we explored potential upstream mechanisms for these effects. Ritonavir, but not the HIV PIs indinavir or nelfinavir, up-regulated the production of transcripts for OC growth factors and the non-canonical Wnt Proteins 5B and 7B as well as activated promoters of nuclear factor-kappaB signaling, but suppressed genes involved in canonical Wnt signaling. Similarly, ritonavir blocked the cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, the molecular node of the Wnt signaling pathway, in association with enhanced beta-catenin ubiquitination. Exposure of OC precursors to LiCl, an inhibitor of the canonical Wnt antagonist GSK-3beta, suppressed OC differentiation, as did adenovirus-mediated overexpression of beta-catenin. These data identify, for the first time, a biologically relevant role for Wnt signaling via beta-catenin in isolated OC precursors and the modulation of Wnt signaling by ritonavir. The reversal of these ritonavir-mediated changes by interferon-gamma provides a model for possible intervention in this metabolic complication of HIV therapy.",,"; file:19095956 Gene Expression Using High-Density Oligonucleotide Microarrays and Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain ReactionEach condition analyzed by large-scale microarrays in- volved three independent primary culture preparations and DNA microarray runs.

This process is involved in pathological conditions such as vascular remodeling or ischemia-reperfusion injury. This study was aimed to obtain a global picture of the response of the endothelial cells to hypoxia with respect to inflammatory genes. To this purpose, we used a low density DNA microarray specifically designed to quantitate the expression of genes involved in the inflammatory pathways and a customized real-time PCR array. The expression of several pro-inflammatory genes known to be NF-kB target genes was decreased after the incubation of endothelial cells under hypoxia. In parallel, a decrease in the DNA binding activity of this transcription factor was observed. On the other hand, HIF-1 DNA binding activity was increased as well as the expression of several genes known to be regulated by this factor. Among them are several pro-inflammatory genes whose overexpression could account for the increase in leukocyte adhesion to the hypoxic endothelial cells. We concluded that hypoxia does not shift the endothelial cell phenotype to a more pro-inflammatory one probably because of a decrease in the expression of several cytokines.

However, in some sexually dimorphic diseases that differ in frequency but not severity, the differences cannot be logically connected to the sex hormones. Therefore, we asked whether any aspect of sexual dimorphism could be attributed to chromosomal rather than hormonal differences. Cells taken from mice at d 10.5 postconception (PC) before sexual differentiation, at d 17.5 PC after the first embryonic assertion of sexual hormones, and at postnatal day 17 (puberty) were cultured and exposed to 400 microM ethanol or 20 microM camptothecin or to infection with influenza A virus (multiplicity of infection of 5). The results showed that untreated male and female cells of the same age grew at similar rates and manifested similar morphology. However, they responded differently to the applied stressors, even before the production of fetal sex hormones. Furthermore, microarray and qPCR analyses of the whole 10.5 PC embryos also revealed differences in gene expression between male and female tissues. Likewise, the exposure of cells isolated from fetuses and adolescent mice to the stressors and/or sex hormones yielded expression patterns that reflected chromosomal sex, with ethanol feminizing male cells and masculinizing female cells. We conclude that cells differ innately according to sex irrespective of their history of exposure to sex hormones.

Background subtracted spot intensities were logged (base 2), and suspect data were filtered out before normalization. The following criteria were used for filtering: negative intensity values, signal/background 1.5, and intensity values in the lowest fifth percentile for either channel. In addition, spots identified manually as poor quality during quantitation, buffer controls, and positive controls were removed. The remaining data were normalized using methods that correct for intensity-dependent bias using a trimmed running aver- age method and for spatial biases using a Euclidean distance- weighted Gaussian function based on the work of Workman et al. (27) and Colantuoni et al. (26). The logged (base 2) ratio of sample to control signals was then determined for each spot, and spot duplicates were averaged. The data were analyzed in Excel to select for spots that differed between sexes by 1.33-fold with P  0.05 (using either paired or two-sample t test as appropriate).

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Estradiol may fulfill a plethora of functions in neurons, in which much of its activity is associated with its capacity to directly bind and dimerize estrogen receptors. This hormone-protein complex can either bind directly to estrogen response elements (ERE's) in gene promoters, or it may act as a cofactor at non-ERE sites interacting with other DNA-binding elements such as AP-1 or c-Jun. Many of the neuroprotective effects described for estrogen have been associated with this mode of action. However, recent evidence suggests that in addition to these ""genomic effects"", estrogen may also act as a more general ""trophic factor"" triggering cytoplasmic signals and extending the potential activity of this hormone. We demonstrated that estrogen receptor alpha associates with beta-catenin and glycogen synthase kinase 3 in the brain and in neurons, which has since been confirmed by others. Here, we show that the action of estradiol activates beta-catenin transcription in neuroblastoma cells and in primary cortical neurons. This activation is time and concentration-dependent, and it may be abolished by the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182780. The transcriptional activation of beta-catenin is dependent on lymphoid enhancer binding factor-1 (LEF-1) and a truncated-mutant of LEF-1 almost completely blocks estradiol TCF-mediated transcription. Transcription of a TCF-reporter in a transgenic mouse model is enhanced by estradiol in a similar fashion to that produced by Wnt3a. In addition, activation of a luciferase reporter driven by the engrailed promoter with three LEF-1 repeats was mediated by estradiol. We established a cell line that constitutively expresses a dominant-negative LEF-1 and it was used in a gene expression microarray analysis. In this way, genes that respond to estradiol or Wnt3a, sensitive to LEF-1, could be identified and validated. Together, these data demonstrate the existence of a new signaling pathway controlled by estradiol in neurons. This pathway shares some elements of the insulin-like growth factor-1/Insulin and Wnt signaling pathways, however, our data strongly suggest that it is different from that of both these ligands. These findings may reveal a set of new physiological roles for estrogens, at least in the Central Nervous System (CNS).",,"; file:19360103 Microarray analysis Gene expression profiles were generated using Applied Biosystems Mouse Genome Survey Microarray.

We developed a low-density DNA microarray which contains 38 genes of the ABC transporter gene family.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"The Wilms' tumor suppressor gene, WT1, functions as a transcriptional regulator that represses or activates the expression of a variety of putative target genes. However, it is not clear which genes are the biological targets of WT1, nor which cellular pathway(s) is critically altered in tumors as a result of WT1 mutation. To investigate in vivo the role of WT1 as a transcription factor in Wilms' tumors, we used cDNA microarrays to compare the expression of putative WT1 target genes in a set of 15 primary Wilmstumors carrying WT1-inactivating mutations versus a set of 16 tumors with no WT1 mutations. We hypothesized that the expression of direct downstream targets of WT1 that are relevant to tumor development would differ between these two genetically distinct sets of tumors. Using the Atlas Human Cancer 1.2 cDNA arrays to quantitate gene expression in the 31 tumors, we found that the expression of one WT1 putative target gene, c-MYC, statistically significantly differed between the two sets of tumors and was upregulated in WT1-mutant tumors. This increase of relative gene expression for c-MYC was confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The differential expression of another putative target gene, EGR1, approached significance and was also upregulated in WT1-mutant tumors. These data, in addition to the coexpression of c-MYC and WT1 in embryonic renal mesenchyme, strongly suggest that c-MYC is a biologically relevant target of WT1 in Wilmstumors.",,"; file:12802290 Hybridization of cDNA expression arrayTo quantify gene expression, the Atlas Human cancer 1.2 cDNA Expression Array was used (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.).

However, nothing else has been reported about the presence of GILZ in the neuroendocrine system. We sought to characterize expression and regulation of GILZ in the chicken embryonic pituitary gland and determine the effect of GILZ overexpression on anterior pituitary hormone levels. Pituitary GILZ mRNA levels increased during embryogenesis to a maximum on the day of hatch, and decreased through the first week after hatch. GILZ expression was rapidly upregulated by corticosterone in embryonic pituitary cells. To determine whether GILZ regulates hormone gene expression in the developing anterior pituitary, we overexpressed GILZ in embryonic pituitary cells and measured mRNA for the major pituitary hormones. Exogenous GILZ increased prolactin mRNA above basal levels, but not as high as that in corticosterone-treated cells, indicating that GILZ may play a small role in lactotroph differentiation. The largest effect we observed was a twofold increase in FSH beta subunit in cells transfected with GILZ but not treated with corticosterone, suggesting that GILZ may positively regulate gonadotroph development in a manner not involving glucocorticoids. In conclusion, this is the first report to characterize avian GILZ and examine its regulation in the developing neuroendocrine system.

First, we implanted the highly metastatic human colon cancer TK-4 orthotopically into the cecal walls of nude mice, followed by twice-daily administration of TSU68 (400 mg/kg/d) or vehicle. Five weeks of treatment with TSU68 significantly inhibited liver metastasis compared with the control group (P<0.001). Next, we analyzed the gene expression profile in premetastatic liver using microarrays. Microarray and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that mRNA levels for the chemokine CXCL1 were significantly increased in tumor-bearing mice compared with non-tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, CXCL1 expression was significantly decreased by TSU68 treatment. CXCR2 expression was detected predominantly on tumor cells in orthotopic tumors compared with ectopic tumors. The number of migrating neutrophils in premetastatic liver was significantly decreased in the TSU68-treated group (P<0.001). The amount of interleukin-12 (IL-12) p40 in the portal vein was significantly decreased by TSU68 (P=0.02). Blockade of both CXCR2 and IL-12 p40 with a neutralizing antibody significantly inhibited liver metastasis.

These analyses revealed the complex nature of the dendritic RNA population, which included RNAs that were not expected to be in the dendrites. Neural activity caused by an electroconvulsive shock triggered a redistribution of the population of dendritic transcriptome towards the area of overlap between the HP and the synaptosome, which is assumed to be neck of spine.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs of 19-25 nucleotides in length that have been linked to the development of cancer. Here, we investigated the role of miRNAs in the biology of NPMc+ AML. The miRNA expression was evaluated in 85 adult de novo AML patients characterized for subcellular localization/mutation status of NPM1 and FLT3 mutations using a custom microarray platform. Data were analyzed by using univariate t test within BRB tools. We identified a strong miRNA signature that distinguishes NPMc+ mutated (n = 55) from the cytoplasmic-negative (NPM1 unmutated) cases (n = 30) and includes the up-regulation of miR-10a, miR-10b, several let-7 and miR-29 family members. Many of the down-regulated miRNAs including miR-204 and miR-128a are predicted to target several HOX genes. Indeed, we confirmed that miR-204 targets HOXA10 and MEIS1, suggesting that the HOX up-regulation observed in NPMc+ AML may be due in part by loss of HOX regulators-miRNAs. FLT3-ITD+ samples were characterized by up-regulation of miR-155. Further experiments demonstrated that the up-regulation of miR-155 was independent from FLT3 signaling. Our results identify a unique miRNA signature associated with NPMc+ AML and provide evidence that support a role for miRNAs in the regulation of HOX genes in this leukemia subtype.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Bone mineral density (BMD) is a major risk factor for osteoporosis. Circulating monocytes may serve as early progenitors of osteoclasts and produce a wide variety of factors important to bone metabolism. However, little is known about the roles of circulating monocytes in relation to the pathophysiology of osteoporosis. Using the Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChip(R) array, we performed a comparative gene expression study of circulating monocytes in subjects with high and low BMD. We identified in total 66 differentially expressed genes including some novel as well as some already known to be relevant to bone metabolism. Three genes potentially contributing to bone metabolism, CCR3 (chemokine receptor 3), HDC (histidine decarboxylase, i.e. the histamine synthesis enzyme), and GCR (glucocorticoid receptor), were confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR as up-regulated in subjects with lower BMD. In addition, significant negative correlation was observed between expression levels of the genes and BMD Z-scores. These three genes and/or their products mediate monocyte chemotaxis, histamine production, and/or sensitivity to glucocorticoids. Our results suggest a novel pathophysiological mechanism for osteoporosis that is characterized by increased recruitment of circulating monocyte into bone, enhanced monocyte differentiation into osteoclasts, as well as osteoclast stimulation via monocyte functional changes. This is the first in vivo microarray study of osteoporosis in humans. The results may contribute to identification of new genes and their functions for osteoporosis and suggest genetic markers to discern individuals at higher risk to osteoporosis with an aim for preventive intervention and treatment.",,"; file:15965235 Preparation of cRNA and Gene Chip Hybridization—Preparation ofMicroarray Study of Osteoporosis cRNA, hybridization, and scanning of the HG-U133A GeneChip® was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).",10.1074/jbc.M501164200,:Users/hpiwowar/Dropbox/TrackingDataReuse/citation benefit in 11k study/full text and detailed citation history of subsample/15965235.pdf:pdf,,0021-9258,The Journal of biological chemistry,"11k-subset-reviewed,Aged,Algorithms,Biological,Bone Density,CCR3,Chemokine,Chemokine: metabolism,Chemotaxis,Female,Gene Expression Regulation,Glucocorticoid,Glucocorticoid: metabolism,Glucocorticoids,Glucocorticoids: metabolism,Histidine Decarboxylase,Histidine Decarboxylase: metabolism,Humans,Lumbar Vertebrae,Lumbar Vertebrae: metabolism,Middle Aged,Models,Monocytes,Monocytes: cytology,Monocytes: metabolism,Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis,Osteoporosis,Osteoporosis: blood,Osteoporosis: genetics,Osteoporosis: pathology,Receptors,Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction,Risk Factors,created-microarray-data","11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data",August,32,29011--29016,15965235,,{\^{}\^{}10156\^{}\^{} A novel pathophysiological mechanism for osteoporosis suggested by an in vivo gene expression study of circulating monocytes.},http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15965235,280,2005

To date clonal catfish cell lines and MLCs have been biologically and phenotypically characterized using a variety of techniques including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), as well as Northern and Southern blotting. To expand the molecular characterization of these cultures, microarray analysis was employed. Clonal B (3B11), macrophage (42TA), and cytotoxic T cell (TS32.15 and TS32.17) lines and MLCs were examined using a cDNA array containing approximately 2500 probes derived from EST libraries prepared from the 42TA macrophage cell line, a MLC, and 5-14-day-old catfish fry. Analysis showed that each cell line displayed a unique RNA expression profile that included a variety of immune-related genes. Pearson correlation analysis indicated that one cytotoxic T cell line (TS32.15) clustered with the MLC, whereas a second cytotoxic T cell line (TS32.17) was more closely associated with a second cluster containing B cells and macrophages.

EIU was induced by a footpad injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in male Lewis rats. The expression of genes in the iris-ciliary body (ICB) at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hr after LPS injection was determined by oligonucleotide microarray analyses and compared to that in control rats. The microarray displayed 9911 genes and expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Cluster analysis was performed for highly up-regulated genes. Selected genes for cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-6), chemokines (RANTES), and immediate early genes (Jun B, c-Fos, and c-Jun) were also studied by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Immunohistochemical studies were performed to localize the protein expression of some immediate early gene products. After LPS injection, the expression of 1930 genes were increased or decreased over 2-folds compared with normal controls by 24 hr. One hundred and seventeen genes were up-regulated over 10-fold, and these were classified into five clusters with similar expression pattern. The immediate early genes and transcription factors genes were included in one cluster of up-regulated genes peaking at 2 hr after the LPS injection. The expressions of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules were highly up-regulated. Real-time PCR analyses for selected genes showed similar expression changes as detected by the microarray analyses. Jun B immunoreactivity was found in the ICB cells at 3 and 6 hr after LPS injection. Gene expression changes after LPS injection were profiled by using an oligonucleotide microarray system.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Chronic infection with cagA-positive Helicobacter pylori is associated with the development of atrophic gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric adenocarcinoma. The cagA gene product CagA is injected into gastric epithelial cells, where it undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases. Translocated CagA disturbs cellular functions by physically interacting with and deregulating intracellular signaling transducers through both tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent and -independent mechanisms. To gain further insights into the pathophysiological activities of CagA in gastric epithelial cells, we executed a genome-wide screening of CagA-responsive genes by using DNA microarray and identified nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factors whose binding sites were overrepresented in the promoter regions of CagA-activated genes. Results of reporter assays confirmed that CagA was capable of activating NFAT in a manner independent of CagA phosphorylation. Expression of CagA in gastric epithelial cells provoked translocation of NFATc3, a member of the NFAT family, from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and activated an NFAT-regulated gene, p21WAF1/Cip1. CagA-mediated NFAT activation was abolished by inhibiting calcineurin or phospholipase Cgamma activity. Furthermore, treatment of cells with H. pylori VacA (vacuolating toxin), which inhibits NFAT activity in T lymphocytes, counteracted the ability of CagA to activate NFAT in gastric epithelial cells. These findings indicate that the two major H. pylori virulence factors inversely control NFAT activity. Considering the pleiotropic roles of NFAT in cell growth and differentiation, deregulation of NFAT, either positively or negatively, depending on the relative exposure of cells to CagA and VacA, may contribute to the various disease outcomes caused by H. pylori infection.",,"; file:15980153 Microarray Analysis.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Inorganic polyphosphate [poly(P)] is a biopolymer existing in almost all cells and tissues, although its biological functions in higher eukaryotes have not been completely elucidated. We previously demonstrated that poly(P) enhances the function of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) by stabilizing them and strengthening the affinity between FGFs and their cell surface receptors. Since FGFs play crucial roles in bone regeneration, we further investigated the effect of poly(P) on the cell differentiation of human stem cells via FGF signaling systems. Human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) isolated from human dental pulp show the characteristics of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). HDPCs secreted FGFs and the proliferation of HDPCs was shown to be enhanced by treatment with poly(P). Cell surface receptor-bound FGF-2 was stably maintained for more than 40 hours in the presence of poly(P). The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was also enhanced by poly(P). The effect of poly(P) on the osteogenic differentiation of HDPCs and human MSCs (hMSCs) were also investigated. After 5 days of treatment with poly(P), type-I collagen expression of both cell types was enhanced. The C-terminal peptide of type-I collagen was also released at higher levels in poly(P)-treated HDPCs. Microarray analysis showed that expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OC) and osteoprotegerin was induced in both cell types by poly(P). Furthermore, induced expression of MMP1, OPN and OC genes in both cells was confirmed by real-time PCR. Calcification of both cell types was clearly observed by alizarin red staining following treatment with poly(P).

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"IRAK-4 is an essential component of the signal transduction complex downstream of the IL-1- and Toll-like receptors. Although regarded as the first kinase in the signaling cascade, the role of IRAK-4 kinase activity versus its scaffold function is still controversial. To investigate the role of IRAK-4 kinase function in vivo, ""knock-in"" mice were generated by replacing the wild type IRAK-4 gene with a mutant gene encoding kinase-deficient IRAK-4 protein (IRAK-4 KD). IRAK-4 kinase was rendered inactive by mutating the conserved lysine residues in the ATP pocket essential for coordinating ATP. Analyses of embryonic fibroblasts and macrophages obtained from IRAK-4 KD mice demonstrate lack of cellular responsiveness to stimulation with IL-1beta or a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist. IRAK-4 kinase deficiency prevents the recruitment of IRAK-1 to the IL-1 receptor complex and its subsequent phosphorylation and degradation. IRAK-4 KD cells are severely impaired in NFkappaB, JNK, and p38 activation in response to IL-1beta or TLR7 ligand. As a consequence, IL-1 receptor/TLR7-mediated production of cytokines and chemokines is largely absent in these cells. Additionally, microarray analysis identified IL-1beta response genes and revealed that the induction of IL-1beta-responsive mRNAs is largely ablated in IRAK-4 KD cells.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Loss of imprinting (LOI) of the IGF2 gene (which encodes insulin-like growth factor II) is the most common genetic or epigenetic alteration in Wilms tumor; LOI involves aberrant activation of the normally repressed maternally inherited allele. We found previously that LOI of IGF2 occurs in approximately half of all Wilms tumors (i.e., those arising from lineage-committed nephrogenic progenitor cells). We investigated whether LOI of IGF2 is associated with relaxation of imprinting at loci other than IGF2 or with widespread alterations in DNA methylation. We stratified 59 Wilms tumor samples by IGF2 LOI status by use of hot-stop reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and/or methylation analysis of the differentially methylated region of the H19 gene and identified 31 samples with and 28 without LOI. We used quantitative allele-specific expression analysis to determine whether six other imprinted genes (i.e., H19, KCNQ1, LIT1, TSSC5, GRB10, and MEG3) had subtle LOI. No statistically significant difference in allele-specific expression between Wilms tumor with or without LOI was found for LIT1, TSSC5, GRB10, and MEG3.

For H19, we also found a slight difference between the groups with (7.5\%, 95\% CI = 2.4\% to 12.7\%) and without (2.2\%, 95\% CI = -3.2\% to 7.6\%) LOI of IGF2 (P = .15 for F test). In 27 tumor samples, we also used a microarray technique to analyze methylation of 378 genes, 38 of which were suspected or confirmed imprinted genes. We found that statistically significant alterations in only the differentially methylated region of the H19 gene were associated with LOI of IGF2.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data-not,"A method is described to perform combined immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in mouse brain sections. The protocol is specific to sections mounted on glass slides. In contrast to earlier methods that require either paraffin embedding or perfusion of the brain with paraformaldehyde, this protocol can be carried out on fresh-frozen, cryostat cut post-fixed sections. This simple and concise protocol increases the applicability of the technique as the RNAse-free immunodetection of antigen is useful by itself for immunologically identifying specific cells of interest and then examining gene expression in those cells using techniques such as real-time PCR and microarray analysis. The use of fresh-frozen, cryocut sections enables reliable detection of easily perturbable post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and improves the quality of results obtained in subsequent in situ hybridization by reducing the background signal and interference from lower cell layers. Inducible transgenic mice that express either a dominant negative mutant form of the cAMP response element binding protein (mCREB) or CREB, in discrete brain regions, were used in this study.

In order to understand the metabolism of these microorganisms under adverse environmental conditions for improved bioremediation efforts, Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough was used as a model organism to study stress response to nitrite, an important intermediate in the nitrogen cycle. Previous physiological studies demonstrated that growth was inhibited by nitrite and that nitrite reduction was observed to be the primary mechanism of detoxification. Global transcriptional profiling with whole-genome microarrays revealed coordinated cascades of responses to nitrite in pathways of energy metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, oxidative stress response, and iron homeostasis. In agreement with previous observations, nitrite-stressed cells showed a decrease in the expression of genes encoding sulfate reduction functions in addition to respiratory oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthase activity. Consequently, the stressed cells had decreased expression of the genes encoding ATP-dependent amino acid transporters and proteins involved in translation. Other genes up-regulated in response to nitrite include the genes in the Fur regulon, which is suggested to be involved in iron homeostasis, and genes in the Per regulon, which is predicted to be responsible for oxidative stress response.",,"; file:16751553 Microarray hybridization, washing, and scanning.

We used a systems biology approach to identify biological networks affected by Ddr2(slie/slie) mutation in ovaries using microarray analysis and validate findings using molecular, cellular, and functional biological assays. Transcriptome analysis indicated several altered gene categories in Ddr2(slie/slie) mutants, including gonadal development, ovulation, antiapoptosis, and steroid hormones. Subsequent biological experiments confirmed the transcriptome analysis predictions. For instance, a significant increase of TUNEL-positive follicles was found in Ddr2(slie/slie) mutants vs. wild type, which confirm the transcriptome prediction for decreased chromatin maintenance and antiapoptosis. Decreases in gene expression were confirmed by RT-PCR and/or qPCR; luteinizing hormone receptor and prostaglandin type E and F receptors in Ddr2(slie/slie) mutants, compared with wild type, confirm hormonal signaling pathways involved in ovulation. Furthermore, deficiencies in immunohistochemistry for DDR2 and luteinizing hormone receptor in the somatic cells, but not the oocytes, of Ddr2(slie/slie) mutant ovaries suggest against an intrinsic defect in germ cells. Indeed, Ddr2(slie/slie) mutants ovulated significantly fewer oocytes; their oocytes were competent to complete meiosis and fertilization in vitro.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"The vertebrate homologues of Drosophila dachsund, DACH1 and DACH2, have been implicated as important regulatory genes in development. DACH1 plays a role in retinal and pituitary precursor cell proliferation and DACH2 plays a specific role in myogenesis. DACH proteins contain a domain (DS domain) that is conserved with the proto-oncogenes Ski and Sno. Since the Ski/Sno proto-oncogenes repress AP-1 and SMAD signaling, we hypothesized that DACH1 might play a similar cellular function. Herein, DACH1 was found to be expressed in breast cancer cell lines and to inhibit transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-induced apoptosis. DACH1 repressed TGF-beta induction of AP-1 and Smad signaling in gene reporter assays and repressed endogenous TGF-beta-responsive genes by microarray analyses. DACH1 bound to endogenous NCoR and Smad4 in cultured cells and DACH1 co-localized with NCoR in nuclear dotlike structures. NCoR enhanced DACH1 repression, and the repression of TGF-beta-induced AP-1 or Smad signaling by DACH1 required the DACH1 DS domain. The DS domain of DACH was sufficient for NCoR binding at a Smad4-binding site. Smad4 was required for DACH1 repression of Smad signaling. In Smad4 null HTB-134 cells, DACH1 inhibited the activation of SBE-4 reporter activity induced by Smad2 or Smad3 only in the presence of Smad4.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Within the field of Saccharomyces cerevisiae functional genomics, DNA microarrays have become a very useful tool to study genome-wide gene-expression changes under diverse experimental conditions. Here, the design and production of a gene microarray, called the 'yeast cell wall chip', specifically tailored to investigate cell wall functions, is described. This array has been validated and shown to be useful to address gene involvement in the regulation of the response to cell wall damage in yeast. The advantages of this tailored gene microarray, which contains 390 genes, in terms of reproducibility, accuracy, versatility and ease of use are reported. Importantly, the microarray design permits the performance of a double hybridization process (two experiments) on the same slide. Cell wall stress leads to the transcriptional activation of a set of genes involved in cell wall remodelling. This response has been shown to be strongly controlled by the MAP kinase (MAPK) Slt2p, but other signalling pathways have also been suggested to be involved in this process. Here, using the tailored microarray, the role of the HOG1 pathway in the regulation of the transcriptional compensatory response to cell wall damage was evaluated by comparing the transcriptional profiles of a hog1 mutant and a wild-type strain in the presence of Congo red. Two genes, YFL014W (HSP12) and YLR414C, were found to be dependent on the Hog1p MAPK for their induction, indicating that an additional level of regulation of cell wall functions is mediated by this MAPK.",,"; file:16000714 RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and microarray hybridization.

These genes were then screened for mivaRNA target sites using several bioinformatic tools. The combination of microarray analysis and bioinformatics allowed us to select the splicing and translation regulator TIA-1 as a putative mivaRNA target. We show that TIA-1 is downregulated at mRNA and protein levels in infected cells expressing functional mivaRNAs and in transfected cells that express mivaRNAI-138, one of the most abundant adenoviral miRNAs. Also, reporter assays show that TIA-1 is downregulated directly by mivaRNAI-138. To determine whether mivaRNAs could target other cellular genes we analyzed 50 additional putative targets. Thirty of them were downregulated in infected or transfected cells expressing mivaRNAs. Some of these genes are important for cell growth, transcription, RNA metabolism and DNA repair.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Endodormant grapevine buds require a period of chilling before they break and begin to grow. Custom Vitis bud cDNA microarrays (9,216 features) were used to examine gene expression patterns in overwintering Vitis riparia buds during 2,000 h of 4A degrees C chilling. Three-node cuttings collected concurrently with buds were monitored to determine dormancy status. Chilling requirement was fulfilled after 1,500 h of chilling; however, 2,000 h of chilling significantly increased the rate of bud break. Microarray analysis identified 1,469 significantly differentially expressed (p value < 0.05) array features when 1,000, 1,500, and 2,000 h of chilling were compared to 500 h of chilling. Functional classification revealed that the majority of genes were involved in metabolism, cell defense/stress response, and genetic information processing. The number of significantly differentially expressed genes increased with chilling hour accumulation. The expression of a group of 130 genes constantly decreased during the chilling period. Up-regulated genes were not detected until the later stages of chilling accumulation. Hierarchical clustering of non-redundant expressed sequence tags revealed inhibition of genes involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism and activation of genes involved in signaling and cell growth. Clusters with expression patterns associated with increased chilling and bud break were identified, indicating several candidate genes that may serve as indicators of bud chilling requirement fulfillment.","[Mathiason, Kathy; He, Dong; Grimplet, Jerome; Fennell, Anne] S Dakota State Univ, Dept Hort Forestry Landscape \& Pk, Brookings, SD 57007 USA; Univ Arizona, Dept Plant Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Univ Arizona, Bio5 Inst, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Or, Etti] Ag","; data\_id:GSE3913; data\_collection\_article:Horvath DP, Soto-Su\'{a}rez M, Anderson JV, Chao WS.

We hypothesized that there exists a postnatal gene expression program that is common to multiple tissues and is responsible for this coordinate growth deceleration. Consistent with this hypothesis, microarray analysis identified more than 1600 genes that were regulated with age (1 vs. 4 wk) coordinately in kidney, lung, and heart of male mice, including many genes that regulate proliferation. As examples, we focused on three growth-promoting genes, Igf2, Mest, and Peg3, that were markedly down-regulated with age. In situ hybridization revealed that expression occurred in organ-specific parenchymal cells and suggested that the decreasing expression with age was due primarily to decreased expression per cell rather than a decreased number of expressing cells. The declining expression of these genes was slowed during hypothyroidism and growth inhibition (induced by propylthiouracil at 0-5 wk of age) in male rats, suggesting that the normal decline in expression is driven by growth rather than by age per se. We conclude that there exists an extensive genetic program occurring during postnatal life. Many of the involved genes are regulated coordinately in multiple organs, including many genes that regulate cell proliferation. At least some of these are themselves apparently regulated by growth, suggesting that, in the embryo, a gene expression pattern is established that allows for rapid somatic growth of multiple tissues, but then, during postnatal life, this growth leads to negative-feedback changes in gene expression that in turn slow and eventually halt somatic growth, thus imposing a fundamental limit on adult body size.",,"; file:19036884 Microarray analysis Twomicrograms ofRNAper sample were processedandanalyzedbythe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Core Facility at the National Institutes of Health.

Drosophila mojavensis, a cactophilic species from the deserts of North America, is one of the most desiccation resistant in the genus, surviving low humidity primarily by reducing its metabolic rate. Genetic control of reduced metabolic rate, however, has yet to be elucidated. We utilized the recently sequenced genome of D. mojavensis to create an oligonucleotide microarray to pursue the identities of the genes involved in metabolic regulation during desiccation. We observed large differences in gene expression between male and female D. mojavensis as well as both quantitative and qualitative sex differences in their ability to survive xeric conditions. As expected, genes associated with metabolic regulation and carbohydrate metabolism were differentially regulated between stress treatments. Most importantly, we identified four points in central metabolism (Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, transaldolase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) that indicate the potential mechanisms controlling metabolic rate reduction associated with desiccation resistance.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) is a potent inhibitor of epithelial cell proliferation. During the development of cervical carcinoma however, an increase in production of TGF-beta1 is accompanied by decreased sensitivity for the growth-limiting effect of TGF-beta1. TGF-beta1 has an anti-proliferative effect on cells of the immune system and thus can be advantageous for tumor progression. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of TGF-beta1 on mRNA expression profile of genes in pathways involved in cell growth and cell death, in cervical carcinoma cell lines with different sensitivity to TGF-beta1. For this purpose, we have investigated changes in gene expression in TGF-beta1 stimulated cervical cancer cell lines with high (CC10B), intermediate (SiHa) and low (HeLa) sensitivity to the anti-proliferative effect of TGF-beta1, at timepoints 0, 6, 12 and 24 h. Microarray analysis, using Affymetrics focus arrays, representing 8973 genes, was used to measure gene expression. In our study novel target genes involved in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and wingless type (Wnt) pathways in response to TGF-beta1 were found. Substantial differences in gene expression between TGF-beta1 sensitive and insensitive cell lines were observed involving genes in TNFalpha, MAPK, Wnt and Smad pathways. Since these pathways are implicated in cell proliferation and cell death, these pathways may play a role in determining the overall sensitivity of a cell to TGF-beta1 induced cell growth inhibition. The results were subsequently validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Increased resistance to TGF-beta1 induced cell growth inhibition was correlated with an elevated production of TGF-beta1 by the cell lines, as measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. TGF-beta1 production did not inhibit cell growth, since blocking TGF-beta1 protein by anti-TGF-beta had no effect on cell proliferation.

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Cell differentiation is controlled by key transcription factors, and a major question is how they orchestrate cell-type-specific genetic programs. Muscle differentiation is a well studied paradigm in which the conserved Mef2 transcription factor plays a pivotal role. Recent genomic studies have identified a large number of mef2-regulated target genes with distinct temporal expression profiles during Drosophila myogenesis. However, the question remains as to how a single transcription factor can control such diverse patterns of gene expression. In this study we used a strategy combining genomics and developmental genetics to address this issue in vivo during Drosophila muscle development. We found that groups of mef2-regulated genes respond differently to changes in mef2 activity levels: some require higher levels for their expression than others. Furthermore, this differential requirement correlates with when the gene is first expressed during the muscle differentiation program. Genes that require higher levels are activated later. These results implicate mef2 in the temporal regulation of muscle gene expression, and, consistent with this, we show that changes in mef2 activity levels can alter the start of gene expression in a predictable manner. Together these results indicate that Mef2 is not an all-or-none regulator; rather, its action is more subtle, and levels of its activity are important in the differential expression of muscle genes. This suggests a route by which mef2 can orchestrate the muscle differentiation program and contribute to the stringent regulation of gene expression during myogenesis.",,"; file:18198273 Microarray Analysis.

A bridged conjugation method using streptavidin increased the signal-to-noise ratio, allowing for further discrimination of target quantitation.

Considering that routine flow cytometers are able to detect up to four fluorescent channels, this novel assay may allow for the specific multiplex detection of a nucleic acid panel in a single tube.",,; file:15659574,10.1093/nar/gni015,:Users/hpiwowar/Dropbox/TrackingDataReuse/citation benefit in 11k study/full text and detailed citation history of subsample/15659574.pdf:pdf,,1362-4962,Nucleic acids research,"11k-subset-reviewed,Base Pair Mismatch,DNA,Flow Cytometry,Fluorescent Dyes,Fluorescent Dyes: chemistry,Microspheres,Molecular Diagnostic Techniques,Nucleic Acid Hybridization,Nucleic Acid Hybridization: methods,Nucleic Acid Probes,Nucleic Acid Probes: chemistry,Nucleic Acids,Nucleic Acids: analysis,Oligonucleotides,Oligonucleotides: analysis,SARS Virus,SARS Virus: genetics,Streptavidin,Streptavidin: chemistry,Viral,Viral: analysis,created-microarray-data","11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data",January,2,e13,15659574,,"{\^{}\^{}10195\^{}\^{} A molecular beacon, bead-based assay for the detection of nucleic acids by flow cytometry.}",http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=548373\&tool=pmcentrez\&rendertype=abstract,33,2005
11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,The pathophysiology of pelvic floor dysfunction resulting in stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women is complex. Evidence suggests that there is also a genetic predisposition towards SUI. We sought to identify differentially expressed genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism in vaginal tissues from women with SUI in the secretory phase of menses compared with asymptomatic women.,,"; file:16126751 We used the GeneChip© Human Genome U133A oligonucleotide chip set from Affymetrix. In each chip set there are two microarrays containing over 1 000 000 unique features and covering more than 39 000 transcript variants. This results in a representation of more than 33 000 well-substantiated human genes (Affymetrix).

11k-subset-reviewed,created-microarray-data,"Remodeling of vascular microenvironments during normal and tumor-induced angiogenesis is an important, yet poorly understood mechanism by which endothelial cells (ECs) contribute to the activation or resolution of angiogenesis. We used microarray analyses to monitor changes in the transcriptome of ECs undergoing angiogenesis when cultured onto Matrigel matrices. This strategy identified 308 genes whose expression in ECs was altered at least 3-fold by angiogenesis, of which 63 genes were found to encode for secretory proteins. In vitro assays that modeled key steps in the angiogenic process showed that several identified genes possessed pro- or anti-angiogenic activities (e.g., SMOC-2, secreted modular calcium-binding protein-2; CRELD-2, cysteine-rich with EGF-like domains-1; MAGP-2, microfibril-associated glycoprotein-2; lumican; and ECM-1, extracellular matrix protein-1). In particular, MAGP-2 expression potentiated EC proliferation and p38 MAPK activation stimulated by the pro-angiogenic factors, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); it also stimulated EC invasion and angiogenic sprouting, and more importantly, promoted the development and infiltration of vessels into Matrigel plugs implanted into genetically normal mice. Conversely, lumican inhibited EC activation of p38 MAPK, as well as their invasion, angiogenic sprouting, and vessel formation in mice. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into how EC stromal remodeling regulates angiogenesis activation and resolution, as well as identify two novel EC-secreted stromal proteins that modulate angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo.",,"; file:17632767 Oligonucleotide microarray analysisMurine brain microvascular MB114 ECs were cultured as previously described [9, 10]. To identify genes differen- tially expressed during angiogenesis, log phase-growing MB114 cells (2 · 106 cells/plate) were plated in triplicate onto 10-cm plates that contained 4 ml of solidified Matrigel matrices [diluted 5:3 in serum-free media (SFM)].
